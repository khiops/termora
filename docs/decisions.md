## MVP-NEXTERM — Implement full nexterm MVP (2026-03-03)

- Plan-provided mode: specs in docs/
- Continuous mode: no pauses between stages
- Model routing: Sonnet implements, Opus reviews, Haiku tests
- HostRail: djb2 hash → HSL palette, 48px column
- ChannelSidebar: groups in localStorage, drag not needed for MVP
- PaneLayout: recursive split tree, localStorage persistence
- CommandPalette: module-level singleton, fuzzy includes match
- ConfigResolver: 4-layer deep merge, null removes key, arrays replace
- CLI: manual argv parser (no yargs/commander), dynamic imports for heavy deps
- Onboarding: auto-create local host, openBrowser via execFile
- Token auth: 32-byte hex, timingSafeEqual, chmod 600 auth.json
- Pairing: 6-digit code (padStart), 60s expiry, max 3 active
- Write-lock: 3-tier (auto-claim, request/grant, force), first-attach=writer
- WriteLockManager: standalone class with DI callbacks
- @xterm/headless CJS: default import + destructure
- Auth hook skips /health and /pair/verify
