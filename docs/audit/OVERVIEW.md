# Codebase Audit: nexterm

**Date:** 2026-03-18
**Mode:** full
**Scope:** full codebase (5 packages + root)

---

## Executive Summary

| Dimension | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Architecture | 8/10 | 🟢 |
| Code Quality | 6/10 | 🟡 |
| Principle Compliance | 6/10 | 🟡 |
| Documentation | 4/10 | 🔴 |
| Test Coverage | 8/10 | 🟢 |

**Overall Health:** 🟡 Needs Attention

The architecture is clean (correct dependency direction, clear separation of concerns between packages), and test coverage is strong (2031 tests, 92 test files). However, several god classes (SessionManager, MetaDAL, useLayout) need decomposition, documentation has drifted significantly from code, and two security issues require immediate attention.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (P0)
- Restrict CORS origins to explicit allowlist (`server.ts:45`)
- Add SSH host key verification (at minimum TOFU with persistence)
- Create README.md

### Short-term (P1)
- Update PROTOCOL.md: add missing WS messages and REST routes
- Update SPEC.md entity model (Host, Channel, LaunchProfile)
- Extract sea-addon-loader to @nexterm/shared
- Fix error response format inconsistency in pair.ts and wallpapers.ts

### Medium-term (P2-P3)
- Decompose SessionManager into sub-managers
- Split MetaDAL into domain-specific DALs
- Extract useLayout into smaller composables
- Add pagination to list API endpoints
