# UX-11 — Connection Experience

## 0. Quick Reference

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Scope | web (UI-only, no schema/protocol changes) |
| Complexity | COMPLEX |
| Time budget | 4h |
| Blocks | 6 |
| BDD scenarios | 37 |
| Risk level | LOW |

## 1. Problem Statement

The host creation/editing modal uses a flat form with a collapsible "Advanced"
section that hides important settings. The command palette (Ctrl+P) provides
basic substring search without fuzzy matching, prefix filters, or extended
actions. The host rail shows only initials and status dots, lacking connection
context at a glance. Together these gaps slow down power users navigating many
hosts and confuse new users configuring their first connection.

## 2. User Stories

### US-01: Power User Navigation
AS A power user managing 20+ hosts
I WANT a command palette (Cmd+K) with fuzzy search, prefix filters, and rich
descriptions
SO THAT I can switch hosts, channels, and trigger actions without touching the
mouse

ACCEPTANCE: Cmd+K opens palette, fuzzy match finds "prod" in
"my-production-server", `@` prefix filters to hosts only, recent items shown
when query is empty

### US-02: New User Onboarding
AS A new user setting up my first SSH connection
I WANT a clear, tabbed form with smart defaults and contextual help
SO THAT I understand each field without reading documentation

ACCEPTANCE: Modal has 3 tabs (Connection, Terminal, Appearance), auth method
selection hides irrelevant fields, port shows "22" as placeholder, typing
`root@192.168.1.1:2222` auto-fills hostname/user/port

### US-03: At-a-Glance Host Context
AS A user with multiple similar hosts
I WANT to see connection details (user@host:port) in the host rail
SO THAT I can distinguish hosts without hovering or opening edit

ACCEPTANCE: Subtitle appears below host badge in rail, tooltip shows connection
duration and channel count

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Invariants

- INV-01: Command palette keybinding is Cmd+K (macOS) / Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux).
  Ctrl+P/Cmd+P no longer opens the palette.
- INV-02: Quick connect is a one-way binding: changes to the quick connect
  field always overwrite sshHost/sshUser/sshPort with the parsed values.
  Clearing the quick connect field does NOT clear the individual fields.
- INV-03: Port defaults to 22 when field is empty (placeholder, not value).
- INV-04: Fuzzy matching scores must be deterministic — same query + same data =
  same ranking.
- INV-05: Modal tab state resets to "Connection" when opening for a new host.
  When editing, tab state persists within the session.
- INV-06: Prefix filters are single-character: `>` (actions), `@` (hosts),
  `#` (channels). The prefix character is stripped from the search query.
- INV-07: Recent items are stored in localStorage (key: `termora:palette-recent`)
  as an array of item IDs (not full objects — survives host renames), max 8
  entries, MRU eviction (most recently used moves to front).
- INV-08: Fuzzy scoring uses named constants (EXACT_MATCH_SCORE,
  PREFIX_MATCH_SCORE, SUBSTRING_MATCH_SCORE, FUZZY_MATCH_BASE). No regex on
  user input — fuzzyMatch operates character-by-character.
- INV-09: Prefix filter with empty query after prefix (e.g., `>` alone) shows
  all items of that type unfiltered.
- INV-10: Save with empty port field omits sshPort from API body (not 0, not
  null) — server applies default 22.
- INV-11: Host preview respects iconType: emoji → show iconValue emoji, auto →
  show computed initials, image → show image.
- INV-12: Modal tabs use ARIA roles: `role="tablist"` on container,
  `role="tab"` + `aria-selected` on headers, `role="tabpanel"` +
  `aria-labelledby` on content panels. Hidden panels get `aria-hidden="true"`.
- INV-13: Auth method change clears irrelevant fields: switching from "key" to
  "agent" clears sshKeyPath. Hidden fields are excluded from the save body.
- INV-14: Quick connect parser accepts optional `ssh://` prefix (stripped
  before parsing). Supports `ssh://user@host:port`.
- INV-15: Quick connect reacts to `input` event (covers paste, drag-drop,
  autocomplete), not just keystrokes.
- INV-16: Tab headers show a validation error indicator (red dot) in real-time
  when any field within that tab has a validation error.

### 3.2 Preconditions

- PRE-01: Quick connect field is only shown in "Manual" source mode (not SSH
  config mode, where fields are pre-populated from config).
- PRE-02: Host preview widget requires a non-empty label to render.
- PRE-03: Connection string subtitle in rail only displays for SSH hosts
  (local host shows "Local").

### 3.3 Effects

- EFF-01: Quick connect parse: typing `user@host:port` sets form.sshUser,
  form.sshHost, form.sshPort. Partial formats supported:
  - `host` → sshHost only
  - `user@host` → sshUser + sshHost
  - `host:port` → sshHost + sshPort
  - `user@host:port` → all three
- EFF-02: Auth method change: selecting "agent" hides keyPath field, selecting
  "password" hides keyPath field, selecting "key" shows keyPath field.
- EFF-03: Palette prefix filter: typing `>settings` shows only actions matching
  "settings". Typing `@prod` shows only hosts matching "prod".
- EFF-04: Palette recent items: executing an item pushes it to front of recents
  list. Duplicates are deduplicated (moved to front, not added twice).
- EFF-05: New palette actions are registered:
  - `action:add-host` — opens Add Host modal
  - `action:settings` — opens Settings panel
  - `action:ssh-import` — opens Batch Import modal
  - `action:toggle-sidebar` — toggles channel sidebar visibility
- EFF-06: Connection string subtitle format: `user@host:port` (port omitted if
  22, user omitted if not set). CSS `text-overflow: ellipsis` with
  `max-width` = rail width for long hostnames.
- EFF-07: Recent items are filtered against existing items before display —
  deleted hosts/channels are silently removed from recents.
- EFF-08: When Save is clicked with validation errors, modal auto-switches to
  the first tab containing an error (Connection > Terminal > Appearance).

### 3.4 Error Handling

- ERR-01: Quick connect with invalid port (non-numeric, <1, >65535) → ignore
  port part, leave field empty.
- ERR-02: Quick connect with IPv6 address (contains `:`) → detect `[::1]:port`
  and `user@[::1]:port` bracket syntax, parse correctly.
- ERR-03: Fuzzy match with empty query → show recent items (if any), then all
  items ungrouped.
- ERR-04: localStorage unavailable (private browsing) → recent items degrade
  gracefully to empty list, no error.

## 4. Technical Design

### 4.1 Architecture Decisions

**Fuzzy matching**: Custom scoring function (~40 lines), no external dependency.
No regex on user input — operates character-by-character to avoid metachar
issues (e.g., `c++`, `host.name`). Score formula uses named constants:
EXACT_MATCH_SCORE (1000) > PREFIX_MATCH_SCORE (500 + length bonus) >
SUBSTRING_MATCH_SCORE (200 + position bonus) > FUZZY_MATCH_BASE (sum of
position-weighted hits). Word boundary bonus: characters matching at the start
of a word (after `-`, `_`, `.`, or at string start) score higher. Sufficient
for datasets <500 items.

**Quick connect parser**: Regex-based, handles 4 formats + IPv6 bracket syntax.
Lives in useHostForm composable as a `parseConnectionString(input: string)`
function.

**Modal tabs**: Vue component-level tabs (no router), using a `activeTab` ref
with values `"connection" | "terminal" | "appearance"`. Tab content rendered
via `v-show` (not `v-if`) to preserve form state across tab switches.

**Recent items**: `useRecentPaletteItems()` composable, localStorage-backed,
returns `{ recentItems, pushRecent, clearRecent }`. Separated from
useCommandPalette to keep concerns clean.

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Block 1: Port Placeholder + Auth Method UX — 20min
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** None
**Items:** A3, A2
**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/HostModal.vue` — change port field from
  value to placeholder, add v-if/v-show on auth method fields, add info notes
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useHostForm.ts` — change sshPort default
  from `22` to `0` (or empty), handle undefined → 22 at save time

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Port field shows "22" as placeholder, empty by default (SC-09, SC-10)
- [ ] Auth "key" shows key path, "agent"/"password" hide it with info note (SC-06..08)
- [ ] Tests: 5 unit tests for auth method visibility + port placeholder behavior

### Block 2: Quick Connect Parser — 30min
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** Block 1 (port is now placeholder-based)
**Items:** A1
**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useHostForm.ts` — add
  `parseConnectionString(input: string)` function, add `quickConnect` ref,
  add watcher to parse and auto-fill form fields
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/HostModal.vue` — add quick connect input
  field above hostname/port/user fields in Connection section

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] All 4 formats parsed correctly (SC-01..04), including user@IPv6 (SC-04b)
- [ ] Invalid port ignored (SC-05)
- [ ] Tests: 9 unit tests for parseConnectionString (4 formats + IPv6 bare +
  user@IPv6 + invalid port + empty string + host:port)

### Block 3: Modal Tabs — 40min
**Type:** Refactor
**Dependencies:** Blocks 1-2 (form fields settled)
**Items:** B3
**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/HostModal.vue` — replace
  `<details class="advanced-section">` with tab navigation. Three tabs:
  Connection (hostname, port, user, auth, key, quick connect, test button),
  Terminal (default shell, keep-alive, history, remote hints),
  Appearance (VisualProfileSettings component). Use `v-show` for tab content.

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Three tabs render with correct content distribution
- [ ] Tab state persists within modal session (v-show, not v-if)
- [ ] Default tab is "Connection" on add, preserved on edit
- [ ] Save with validation error auto-switches to first errored tab (SC-10b)
- [ ] Tests: 4 unit tests for tab switching + content visibility + error tab switch

### Block 4: Host Preview in Modal — 30min
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** Block 3 (tabs exist, preview placement decided)
**Items:** A4
**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/HostModal.vue` — add preview widget in
  modal header area (above tabs). Shows badge with initials (same logic as
  HostRail), color from form.color, status dot mock (gray).
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useHostForm.ts` — add `initials`
  computed (first 2 chars of label, uppercased)

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Preview updates reactively with label and color (SC-11, SC-12)
- [ ] Preview hidden when label empty (SC-13)
- [ ] Preview shows emoji when iconType="emoji" (SC-11b)
- [ ] Tests: 4 unit tests for initials, emoji icon, color, hidden-when-empty

### Block 5: Connection String in Rail — 30min
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** None (independent of modal changes)
**Items:** B2
**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/HostRail.vue` — add subtitle line below
  badge (when rail is wide enough / labels shown), update `getTooltip()` to
  include channel count and connection duration
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useHostGroups.ts` — (if exists) or
  inline in HostRail: add `getSubtitle(host)` helper returning formatted
  connection string

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] SSH hosts show `user@host:port` subtitle, port omitted if 22 (SC-26, SC-27)
- [ ] Local host shows "Local" subtitle (SC-28)
- [ ] Tests: 4 unit tests for subtitle formatting (full, no-port, no-user, local)

### Block 6: Command Palette v2 — 90min
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** None (independent of modal/rail changes)
**Items:** B1'
**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useCommandPalette.ts` — refactor
  `results` computed:
  - Replace substring filter with `fuzzyMatch(query, text): number` scoring
  - Add prefix detection (`>`, `@`, `#`) with type filtering
  - Search hosts by `label + sshHost` (concatenated)
  - Add `description` field to PaletteItem (rich subtitle)
  - Register 4 new actions (add-host, settings, ssh-import, toggle-sidebar)
  - Sort results by fuzzy score descending
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useRecentPaletteItems.ts` — new
  composable: `{ recentItems, pushRecent, clearRecent }`, localStorage-backed,
  max 5 items, FIFO eviction, deduplication
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/CommandPalette.vue` — add description
  line under item label, add "Recent" group header, update empty state
- `packages/clients/web/src/App.vue` — change keybinding from `p`/`P` to
  `k`/`K` in `onGlobalKeydown()`

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Cmd+K/Ctrl+K opens palette, Ctrl+P does not (SC-14)
- [ ] Fuzzy matching with relevance ranking (SC-15)
- [ ] Prefix filters work for all 3 types (SC-16..18)
- [ ] Host search includes sshHost (SC-19)
- [ ] Rich descriptions on host items (SC-20)
- [ ] Recent items on empty query (SC-21, SC-24, SC-24b, SC-25)
- [ ] Prefix with empty query shows all of type (SC-16b)
- [ ] New actions: Add Host, Settings (SC-22, SC-23)
- [ ] Tests: 18 unit tests (fuzzy scoring, prefix parsing incl. empty-after-prefix,
  recent items CRUD + deleted item filtering, new actions, keybinding,
  description formatting)

## 7. Test Strategy

### Test Pyramid

| Level | Count | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Unit | ~43 | Fuzzy matching, parsing, formatting, composable logic |
| Integration | 0 | No API changes |
| E2E | 0 | Optional manual verification via dev server |

### Test Data Requirements

- **Fixtures:** Mock host list (5 hosts with varied labels/hostnames), mock
  channel list (3 channels), mock action list
- **Mocks:** `useHostsStore` (sortedHosts), `useChannelsStore` (channels),
  `useLayout` (splitPane, closeTab), `useAuthStore`, `useWriteLockStore`,
  localStorage (for recent items)
- **New test files:**
  - `useCommandPalette.spec.ts` — extend existing 18 tests with ~15 new
  - `useRecentPaletteItems.spec.ts` — ~5 tests
  - `useHostForm.spec.ts` — extend with ~8 tests for parseConnectionString
  - `HostModal.spec.ts` — extend with ~7 tests for tabs + auth UX + preview
  - `HostRail.spec.ts` — extend with ~3 tests for subtitle

### Fuzzy Match Test Cases

| Query | Input | Expected Score | Reason |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
| "prod" | "prod-db" | 500+ | Prefix match |
| "prod" | "my-production-server" | 200+ | Substring match |
| "prod" | "dev-proxy" | 0 | No match |
| "pdb" | "prod-db" | 50+ | Fuzzy: p...d...b |
| "" | any | 0 | Empty query matches all (no scoring) |

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Fuzzy match too slow on 500+ hosts | L | L | Score is O(n*m) per item, <1ms for 500 items |
| Modal tab refactor breaks existing tests | M | M | v-show preserves DOM, tests should still find elements |
| Ctrl+K conflicts with browser "focus URL bar" | M | M | preventDefault() stops browser default; document in help |
