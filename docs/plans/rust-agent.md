# Specification: Rust Agent Rewrite (async-xpty + termora-agent)

## 0. Quick Reference

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Scope | agent (full rewrite TS → Rust) |
| Complexity | COMPLEX |
| Time budget | ~50-60h |
| Blocks | 10 |
| BDD scenarios | 42 |
| Risk level | MEDIUM |
| Deliverables | `async-xpty` crate (public) + `termora-agent` binary |
| Adversarial | Applied (19 challenges, 18 valid, 1 deferred) |

## 1. Problem Statement

Node.js SEA cannot reliably distribute native addons like node-pty. ConPTY hangs and WinPTY crashes inside SEA on Windows. The packaging story (dlopen hacks, PATH manipulation, asset extraction) is fragile and unsustainable. A native Rust agent eliminates the entire Node.js SEA dependency chain — one static binary per platform, no runtime, no native addon loading.

Additionally, no production-quality async PTY crate exists in the Rust ecosystem. portable-pty is sync-only with a critical unpatched Windows regression (v0.9.0, issue #6783, 8 months open). Creating `async-xpty` fills this gap.

## 2. User Stories

### US-1: Reliable Windows Agent

```
AS A termora user on Windows
I WANT the agent binary to work without crashes or hangs
SO THAT I can use termora on Windows with the same reliability as Linux

ACCEPTANCE: Agent spawns PTY via ConPTY, handles I/O, resize, and exit
            without deadlocks or garbage reads on Windows 10+
```

### US-2: Single Native Binary

```
AS A termora developer/operator
I WANT a single native binary per platform for the agent
SO THAT distribution is trivial (no Node.js, no native addon hacks, no SEA)

ACCEPTANCE: `termora-agent` binary runs standalone on linux-x64, windows-x64,
            darwin-arm64 with zero runtime dependencies
```

### US-3: Protocol Compatibility

```
AS A termora hub
I WANT the Rust agent to speak the exact same MessagePack protocol
SO THAT zero hub modifications are needed — drop-in replacement

ACCEPTANCE: Hub cannot distinguish Rust agent from TS agent.
            All 17 message types work identically.
```

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Invariants (always true)

- INV-01: All messages use 4-byte LE length prefix + MessagePack payload
- INV-02: All field names are snake_case on the wire
- INV-03: HELLO is always the first message sent by agent
- INV-04: Each channel has a monotonically increasing `seq` counter for OUTPUT
- INV-05: `channel_id` is a ULID (agent-generated if not provided in SPAWN)
- INV-06: Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings
- INV-07: Max frame size is 10 MB
- INV-08: Elevation secrets use `Zeroizing<String>` (zeroize crate) — never plain `String`
- INV-09: Agent never persists passwords to disk
- INV-10: DESTROY is idempotent — destroying an already-dead channel is a no-op (no error)
- INV-11: FrameReader handles partial frames (accumulates bytes across reads)
- INV-12: async-xpty stays at 0.x.y semver until stabilized (no premature 1.0)

### 3.2 Preconditions (required before action)

- PRE-01: Agent must send HELLO before hub sends any command
- PRE-02: SPAWN requires valid shell path (resolved by agent or provided)
- PRE-03: ATTACH requires channel to exist (alive or buffered)
- PRE-04: INPUT/RESIZE/DESTROY require channel to exist and be alive
- PRE-05: Daemon mode requires valid socket path (≤100 bytes)

### 3.3 Effects (what changes)

- EFF-01: SPAWN creates a PTY process + headless terminal mirror
- EFF-02: OUTPUT includes `seq` (per-channel counter) and `ts` (wall clock)
- EFF-03: RESIZE updates both PTY dimensions and headless terminal dimensions
- EFF-04: DESTROY kills PTY process and removes channel from registry (idempotent — no-op if already dead)
- EFF-05: CHANNEL_EXIT fires when PTY process exits (natural or killed); concurrent DESTROY + natural exit handled gracefully
- EFF-06: In daemon mode, new connection displaces previous (last-writer-wins)
- EFF-07: On daemon reconnect, agent enumerates all channels via AGENT_CHANNEL_STATE

### 3.4 Error Handling

- ERR-01: Unknown shell → SPAWN_ERR `SHELL_NOT_FOUND`
- ERR-02: Permission denied on PTY spawn → SPAWN_ERR `PERMISSION_DENIED`
- ERR-03: Generic PTY failure → SPAWN_ERR `PTY_SPAWN_FAILED`
- ERR-04: Elevation needs password but none given → SPAWN_ERR `ELEVATION_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`
- ERR-05: Unknown message type → ERROR `INVALID_MESSAGE`
- ERR-06: Operation on unknown channel → ERROR `CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND`
- ERR-07: stdin EOF (stdio mode) → graceful shutdown (destroy all PTYs)
- ERR-08: SIGTERM/SIGINT → graceful shutdown
- ERR-09: Frame > 10 MB → protocol error, close connection
- ERR-10: SPAWN with duplicate channel_id (already exists) → SPAWN_ERR `CHANNEL_EXISTS`

## 4. Technical Design

### 4.1 Architecture Decision

Two Rust crates in a Cargo workspace at monorepo root:

1. **async-xpty** — Public crate. Cross-platform async PTY. Direct OS API calls via `nix` (Unix) and `windows-sys` (Windows). Tokio AsyncRead/AsyncWrite. Not coupled to termora.

2. **termora-agent** — Binary crate. Full protocol implementation. Depends on async-xpty for PTY, rmp-serde for MessagePack, vt100 for terminal state mirror.

**Why new crate vs portable-pty dependency:** portable-pty is sync-only (requires spawn_blocking for every read), has a critical unpatched Windows regression (#6783), is tightly coupled to the wezterm monorepo with no independent release cycle, and no maintained fork exists. Building async-native from OS APIs is ~1000 LoC for both platforms, which is less maintenance burden than working around a broken dependency.

### 4.3 Key Dependencies

| Crate | Purpose | Version |
|-------|---------|---------|
| tokio | Async runtime (full features) | 1.x |
| rmp-serde | MessagePack encode/decode | 1.x |
| serde | Serialization framework | 1.x |
| vt100 | Terminal state parser (snapshots, title, bell) | 0.15+ |
| nix | Unix syscalls (openpty, forkpty, ioctl, waitpid) | 0.29+ |
| windows-sys | Windows API (CreatePseudoConsole, etc.) | 0.59+ |
| ulid | ULID generation | 1.x |
| clap | CLI argument parsing | 4.x |
| tracing | Structured logging | 0.1.x |
| serde_bytes | Binary field serialization (Vec<u8> → MsgPack Bin) | 0.11+ |
| zeroize | Secure memory zeroing for secrets | 1.x |

### 4.4 Protocol Wire Format

All messages serialize with `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]`. The `type` field is a string tag, NOT renamed (stays UPPER_SNAKE_CASE like `"SPAWN"`, `"OUTPUT"`).

**CRITICAL (from /llm review — 3/3 LLMs flagged):**
- rmp-serde default serializes structs as **MessagePack arrays** (positional). The TS hub expects **maps** (named keys). Must use `rmp_serde::encode::to_vec_named()` or `Serializer::with_struct_map()`. Without this, protocol is broken.
- Binary fields (`data` in INPUT/OUTPUT) must use `#[serde(with = "serde_bytes")]` to serialize as MessagePack Bin, not as integer arrays. Without this, `Uint8Array` in JS decodes incorrectly.

```rust
#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]
enum AgentMessage {
    #[serde(rename = "HELLO")]
    Hello { version: u32, agent_version: String, capabilities: Vec<String>, ... },
    #[serde(rename = "SPAWN_OK")]
    SpawnOk { request_id: String, channel_id: String },
    #[serde(rename = "OUTPUT")]
    Output {
        channel_id: String,
        seq: u64,
        ts: String,
        #[serde(with = "serde_bytes")]
        data: Vec<u8>,  // MessagePack Bin, NOT integer array
    },
    // ... all 17 message types
}

// Encoding: MUST use named/map serialization
let bytes = rmp_serde::to_vec_named(&message)?;
// NOT: rmp_serde::to_vec(&message)  ← this produces arrays!
```

Framing: `[4-byte LE u32 length][MessagePack payload]`. Max 10 MB.

### 4.5 Snapshot Format Compatibility

The TS agent uses xterm.js SerializeAddon which produces a proprietary string format. The Rust agent uses `vt100` crate which has a different internal representation.

**Strategy:** The snapshot `serialized` field contains VT escape sequences that reconstruct the terminal state. The `vt100` crate can produce this via `screen.contents_formatted()` which outputs ANSI escape sequences. The UI's xterm.js can consume raw ANSI — it doesn't need SerializeAddon format specifically.

**Known limitation (from /llm review — 3/3 LLMs flagged):** vt100 snapshots may not preserve soft-wrap status of lines. If the UI terminal is resized after snapshot restore, text won't reflow correctly (hard newlines baked in). This is acceptable for MVP — the TS agent's SerializeAddon has the same limitation in practice. Scrollback content must be included in snapshot (iterate full history, not just visible viewport).

**CSI 6n auto-response (from /llm review — 2/3 LLMs flagged):** When auto-responding to `\x1b[6n` cursor position queries, respond with the **actual cursor position from vt100 state** (not static `\x1b[1;1R`). This prevents issues with applications (vim, tmux) that use CPR for layout. The agent IS the terminal for the PTY process — responding is correct behavior.

**Verification needed:** Block 5 exit criteria includes a compatibility test confirming xterm.js renders vt100-produced snapshots identically, including cursor positioning via `\x1b[row;colH`.

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Block 1: async-xpty — Unix PTY (S, ~3h)

**Type:** Feature slice (crate foundation)
**Dependencies:** None

**Files:**
- `Cargo.toml` (workspace root) — create Rust workspace
- `crates/async-xpty/Cargo.toml` — crate manifest
- `crates/async-xpty/src/lib.rs` — public API: `PtyProcess`, `PtySize`, `ExitStatus`, `CommandBuilder`
- `crates/async-xpty/src/command.rs` — `CommandBuilder` (shell, args, cwd, env)
- `crates/async-xpty/src/unix.rs` — `openpty()`, `forkpty()`, session isolation (`setsid`), **controlling terminal (`TIOCSCTTY`)**, FD cleanup, `TIOCSWINSZ`, tokio `AsyncFd` wrapper for async I/O

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] `cargo build` succeeds on Linux/macOS
- [ ] `CommandBuilder::new("/bin/sh").spawn()` returns `PtyProcess`
- [ ] Async read from PTY returns shell prompt (using `AsyncFd`, NOT `spawn_blocking`)
- [ ] Async write sends input to shell
- [ ] `resize(cols, rows)` works
- [ ] Exit code detected on shell exit
- [ ] **Ctrl+C test:** writing `\x03` to PTY terminates a `sleep` command (validates `TIOCSCTTY` set correctly)
- [ ] **macOS explicit test:** `cargo test` passes on macOS (openpty/ioctl timing differences)
- [ ] SC-01, SC-02, SC-03, SC-04, SC-05, SC-06, SC-08 pass

### Block 2: async-xpty — Windows ConPTY (M, ~5h)

**Type:** Feature slice (platform implementation)
**Dependencies:** Block 1

**Files:**
- `crates/async-xpty/src/windows.rs` — `CreatePseudoConsole`, pipe setup, `STARTUPINFOEX`, attribute lists, `ResizePseudoConsole`, `ClosePseudoConsole`, async pipe I/O via tokio named pipes, `\x1b[6n` auto-response

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] `cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` succeeds
- [ ] PTY spawn with `cmd.exe` works

### Block 3: termora-agent — Scaffold + Framing + HELLO (S, ~3h)

**Type:** Feature slice (agent foundation)
**Dependencies:** Block 1

**Files:**
- `crates/termora-agent/Cargo.toml` — binary crate, depends on async-xpty
- `crates/termora-agent/src/main.rs` — CLI args (clap): `--daemon`, `--socket`, `--version`; stdio mode entry
- `crates/termora-agent/src/protocol.rs` — all message structs with serde `#[serde(tag = "type")]`, snake_case rename
- `crates/termora-agent/src/framing.rs` — `FrameReader` (4-byte LE prefix + msgpack decode, handles partial frames across reads), `encode_frame()` (length prefix + msgpack encode)
- `crates/termora-agent/src/shell.rs` — `detect_available_shells()`, `get_default_shell()` per OS
- `crates/termora-agent/src/handler.rs` — `AgentHandler` stub with `send_hello()`

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] `termora-agent --version` prints version
- [ ] Agent started in stdio mode sends HELLO as first frame
- [ ] HELLO contains correct version, capabilities, available_shells
- [ ] Frame encoding uses `rmp_serde::to_vec_named()` (map serialization, NOT array)
- [ ] Binary fields use `#[serde(with = "serde_bytes")]` (MessagePack Bin, NOT integer array)
- [ ] Frame encoding matches TS agent format (verified with `@msgpack/msgpack` decode)
- [ ] SC-09, SC-10 pass

### Block 4: termora-agent — SPAWN + I/O (M, ~5h)

**Type:** Feature slice (core functionality)
**Dependencies:** Block 3

**Files:**
- `crates/termora-agent/src/handler.rs` — SPAWN, INPUT, RESIZE, DESTROY dispatch
- `crates/termora-agent/src/pty.rs` — `PtyManager`: channel registry (`HashMap<String, PtyChannel>`), spawn, write, resize, destroy
- `crates/termora-agent/src/batch.rs` — output batching: single global timer loop flushes all channels (NOT per-channel timers), 16ms interval or 4KB per channel threshold
- `crates/termora-agent/src/expand.rs` — `expand_vars()`: `${VAR}` syntax, one-pass, no recursion, case-insensitive on Windows

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] SPAWN creates PTY, returns SPAWN_OK with ULID channel_id
- [ ] INPUT writes to PTY stdin
- [ ] OUTPUT messages flow with correct seq, ts, data
- [ ] Output batching: 16ms or 4KB whichever first
- [ ] RESIZE updates PTY and reports success
- [ ] DESTROY kills PTY, CHANNEL_EXIT sent (idempotent — no error if already dead)
- [ ] Duplicate channel_id → SPAWN_ERR `CHANNEL_EXISTS`
- [ ] Variable expansion works (`${HOME}` → value, `\${HOME}` → literal, shell NOT expanded, no recursive expansion)
- [ ] SC-11, SC-12, SC-13, SC-14, SC-18, SC-19, SC-20, SC-21, SC-25, SC-26, SC-39, SC-40, SC-41, SC-42 pass

### Block 5: termora-agent — Terminal Mirror + Snapshots (M, ~4h)

**Type:** Feature slice (terminal state)
**Dependencies:** Block 4

**Files:**
- `crates/termora-agent/src/headless.rs` — `HeadlessMirror`: wraps `vt100::Parser` (scrollback: 1000 lines default, configurable), feeds PTY output, extracts title (OSC 0/2), bell (`\x07`), notification (OSC 9), produces snapshot
- `crates/termora-agent/src/pty.rs` — integrate HeadlessMirror into PtyChannel

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] All PTY output is mirrored to vt100 parser
- [ ] SNAPSHOT_REQ returns SNAPSHOT_RES with serialized terminal state (ANSI sequences)
- [ ] Snapshot includes correct cols, rows, cursor_x, cursor_y, last_seq
- [ ] TITLE_CHANGE sent on OSC 0/2 detection (debounced 100ms)
- [ ] BELL sent on `\x07` (throttled 100ms)
- [ ] NOTIFICATION sent on OSC 9 (sanitized, max 256 chars, throttled 500ms)
- [ ] **Snapshot compatibility test:** vt100-produced snapshot renders correctly in xterm.js
- [ ] SC-22, SC-23, SC-30, SC-31, SC-32 pass

### Block 6: termora-agent — Process Title + Events (S, ~3h)

**Type:** Feature slice (OS integration)
**Dependencies:** Block 4

**Files:**
- `crates/termora-agent/src/process.rs` — `ProcessTitlePoller`: periodic foreground process name detection
  - Linux: read `/proc/{pid}/comm` + `/proc/{pid}/cmdline`
  - macOS: `ps -p {pid} -o comm=`
  - Windows: `wmic process where ProcessId={pid} get Name`

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Process title changes detected and sent as PROCESS_TITLE
- [ ] Polling stops when channel exits
- [ ] Poll interval: 2s default, max 1 concurrent poll at a time (serialize, don't parallelize 50 wmic calls)
- [ ] Works on Linux (proc filesystem), macOS (ps), Windows (wmic)
- [ ] SC-33 passes

### Block 7: termora-agent — Elevation (M, ~4h)

**Type:** Feature slice (privilege escalation)
**Dependencies:** Block 4

**Files:**
- `crates/termora-agent/src/elevation.rs` — all elevation methods: sudo, doas, pkexec, gsudo, custom
  - Passwordless detection (sudo -n, doas -n)
  - ASKPASS script creation: `O_EXCL` + mode 0700, in user-private tmpdir (not world-readable /tmp)
  - Secret zeroing via `zeroize` crate (`Zeroizing<String>`) — NOT `String::clear()`
  - Cleanup: delete ASKPASS script after 1s + on shutdown (SIGTERM handler cleans up orphaned temp files)

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Passwordless sudo detection works
- [ ] ASKPASS temp file created with `O_EXCL` + mode 0700 in secure tmpdir
- [ ] ASKPASS script cleaned up after 1s AND on SIGTERM (no orphans)
- [ ] elevation_secret uses `Zeroizing<String>`, zeroed in memory after use
- [ ] All 5 methods work: sudo, doas, pkexec, gsudo, custom
- [ ] ELEVATION_PASSWORD_REQUIRED returned when password needed but not provided
- [ ] SC-15, SC-16, SC-17 pass

### Block 8: termora-agent — Daemon Mode (M, ~5h)

**Type:** Feature slice (persistence)
**Dependencies:** Block 4

**Files:**
- `crates/termora-agent/src/daemon.rs` — UDS server:
  - Socket bind with retry (3 attempts, random backoff 100-500ms)
  - Stale socket cleanup
  - **Socket permissions: 0600** (owner-only, no group/other access)
  - Connection handling with per-connection FrameReader
  - Connection displacement (last-writer-wins)
  - AGENT_CHANNEL_STATE enumeration on reconnect
  - Output buffer (ring buffer for disconnected periods)
  - Frame queue with backpressure (max 1000 frames)
  - Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM → destroy all, close socket, unlink)
  - Logging to file (state dir + agent.log)
  - **Windows:** UDS on Windows 10 1803+ (same as TS agent); named pipes as fallback if UDS unavailable

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] `termora-agent --daemon --socket /tmp/test.sock` starts UDS server
- [ ] Socket file has permissions 0600 (owner-only)
- [ ] Hub connects, receives HELLO + channel state + CHANNEL_STATE_END
- [ ] New connection displaces old (last-writer-wins)
- [ ] Output buffered while no hub connected
- [ ] Backpressure: frame queue drains on socket.drain
- [ ] SIGTERM triggers clean shutdown
- [ ] SC-34, SC-35, SC-36, SC-37 pass

### Block 9: termora-agent — Robustness (S, ~3h)

**Type:** Feature slice (reliability)
**Dependencies:** Block 4

**Files:**
- `crates/termora-agent/src/handler.rs` — HEARTBEAT/ACK, ATTACH/ATTACH_OK, ERROR handling, unknown message handling
- `crates/termora-agent/src/main.rs` — stdin EOF detection, SIGTERM handler, graceful shutdown

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] HEARTBEAT_ACK echoes ts from HEARTBEAT
- [ ] ATTACH returns ATTACH_OK with snapshot + last_seq
- [ ] Unknown message type → ERROR INVALID_MESSAGE (no crash)
- [ ] stdin EOF → destroy all PTYs, exit 0
- [ ] SIGTERM → destroy all PTYs, exit 0
- [ ] Backpressure in stdio mode: pause stdin when stdout full
- [ ] SC-24, SC-27, SC-28, SC-29, SC-38 pass

### Block 10: Integration + CI (M, ~5h)

**Type:** Integration / Infra
**Dependencies:** Blocks 1–9

**Files:**
- `crates/termora-agent/tests/integration/` — end-to-end tests: spawn Rust agent as child process, send MessagePack frames, verify responses
- `.github/workflows/rust-agent.yml` — CI: build + test on linux-x64, windows-x64, darwin-arm64
- `crates/termora-agent/tests/protocol_compat.rs` — decode/encode compatibility with TS `@msgpack/msgpack`
- `scripts/build-rust-agent.sh` — cross-compilation helper

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Integration test: spawn Rust agent → send HELLO check → SPAWN → INPUT → verify OUTPUT → DESTROY → verify CHANNEL_EXIT
- [ ] Protocol compatibility: Rust agent frames decodable by TS hub (and vice versa)
- [ ] CI passes on all 3 targets (linux-x64, windows-x64, darwin-arm64)
- [ ] Binary size < 10 MB per platform
- [ ] Hub TS can spawn Rust agent binary as child_process and communicate normally
- [ ] US-1, US-2, US-3 acceptance criteria met

## 7. Test Strategy

### Test Pyramid

| Level | Count | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Unit | ~60 | async-xpty API, framing, protocol serde, variable expansion, shell detection, elevation logic |
| Integration | ~20 | Agent binary spawned as subprocess, full protocol exchange |
| Cross-platform | ~10 | Platform-specific PTY (Unix/Windows), shell detection, process title |

### Test Framework

- **Rust tests:** `cargo test` with `#[tokio::test]` for async
- **Integration:** spawn `termora-agent` binary, communicate via stdin/stdout pipes
- **Protocol compat:** encode frames in Rust, decode in TS (and vice versa) using shared test vectors

### Test Data

- **Fixtures:** predefined MessagePack frames for each message type
- **Mocks:** None needed — tests use real PTY (real shell, real I/O)
- **Platform CI:** GitHub Actions matrix (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest)

### What NOT to test

- Hub behavior (unchanged, covered by existing 2163 TS tests)
- UI behavior (unchanged)
- SSH transport (hub responsibility)

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| ConPTY `\x1b[6n` deadlock | H | H | Built-in detection + auto-response in async-xpty (Block 2) |
| vt100 snapshot ≠ xterm.js SerializeAddon | M | M | Block 5 includes compatibility test; fallback: raw ANSI reconstruction |
| rmp-serde ↔ @msgpack/msgpack field ordering | M | L | Protocol compat test in Block 10; use `#[serde(rename_all)]` consistently |
| Cross-compile CI complexity | L | M | Start with native builds, add cross-compile incrementally |
| Process title polling platform gaps | L | L | Already solved in TS agent, direct port |
| Daemon mode on Windows (UDS vs named pipes) | M | M | UDS on Win10 1803+ (like TS agent); named pipe fallback in Block 8 |
| async-xpty takes longer than expected | M | M | Fallback: depend on portable-pty 0.8.1 + spawn_blocking temporarily |
| Rust optimizer removes secret zeroing | H | M | `zeroize` crate uses compiler barriers to prevent optimization |
| ASKPASS temp file race condition | H | L | `O_EXCL` + mode 0700 + user-private tmpdir + cleanup on shutdown |
