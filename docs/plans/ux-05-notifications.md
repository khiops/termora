# Specification: UX-05 Notifications

## 0. Quick Reference (ALWAYS VISIBLE)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Scope | agent, hub, shared, web |
| Complexity | COMPLEX |
| Time budget | 7h |
| Blocks | 7 |
| BDD scenarios | 32 |
| Risk level | MEDIUM |

## 1. Problem Statement

Users have no way to know when background terminals produce output or receive bell signals. There are no activity indicators, no bell badges, no desktop notifications, no sound alerts, and no "unread lines" tracking. This story delivers the full notification pipeline from agent bell/OSC 9 detection through hub routing to UI visual indicators, desktop notifications, sound, and scroll behavior management.

## 2. User Stories

### US-01: Activity & Bell Awareness
AS A nexterm user running multiple terminals
I WANT to see which background tabs have new output or bell alerts
SO THAT I can notice important events without constantly switching tabs

ACCEPTANCE: Blue dot for activity, red badge with count for bells, badges on tabs + sidebar + host rail

### US-02: Desktop Notifications
AS A user working in another application
I WANT to receive desktop notifications when a terminal rings the bell or sends OSC 9
SO THAT I don't miss build completions, errors, or explicit alerts

ACCEPTANCE: Notification API integration, grouping within 5s window, click-to-focus

### US-03: Scroll Resume & Unread Lines
AS A user switching between tabs
I WANT to see where I left off and how many new lines appeared
SO THAT I can review new output without losing my scroll position

ACCEPTANCE: Configurable scroll mode (auto/alwaysBottom/alwaysResume), unread lines bar, mark-as-read

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Invariants (always true)

- INV-01: Activity dot is blue, bell badge is red — never the same color
- INV-02: Activity is detected UI-side only (any non-whitespace OUTPUT on inactive tab) — no protocol change. Whitespace-only output is ignored (SC-09).
- INV-03: Bell detection happens agent-side via xterm.js headless onBell() — sends BELL message
- INV-04: OSC 9 detection happens agent-side via parser hook — sends NOTIFICATION message
- INV-05: Desktop notifications only fire when document.hidden or tab is not focused
- INV-06: Sound plays only on bell, never on activity
- INV-07: Badge counts are per-channel, host rail shows aggregated sum across channels
- INV-08: Unread lines bar only appears on tab switch, not on scroll-up from bottom
- INV-09: Custom sound file MUST be a filename only (no path separators), resolved relative to ~/.config/nexterm/sounds/. Hub serves at /public/sounds/. Absolute paths and URLs rejected.
- INV-10: Agent MUST throttle BELL messages to at most 1 per 100ms per channel. OSC 9 NOTIFICATION messages throttled to 1 per 500ms per channel.
- INV-11: Hub MUST rate-limit BELL forwarding to at most 10 per second per channel. NOTIFICATION messages rate-limited to 5 per second per channel.
- INV-12: OSC 9 message text MUST be sanitized agent-side: strip control characters, strip HTML tags, truncate to 256 chars, trim whitespace.

### 3.2 Preconditions (required before action)

- PRE-01: Desktop notifications require Notification API permission granted by user
- PRE-02: Custom sound requires a valid audio file path configured
- PRE-03: Activity detection requires channel tab to be NOT the currently active tab

### 3.3 Effects (what changes)

- EFF-01: BEL char in PTY output → agent sends BELL message → hub forwards to UI → bell count increments
- EFF-02: OSC 9 escape in PTY output → agent sends NOTIFICATION message → hub forwards to UI → desktop notification shown
- EFF-03: OUTPUT received on inactive tab → activity dot appears (subject to debounce)
- EFF-04: Tab becomes active + scroll to bottom → both activity dot and bell badge clear
- EFF-05: "Mark as read" click → both badges clear, scroll position maintained
- EFF-06: "Jump to bottom" click → both badges clear, scrolls to bottom
- EFF-07: Natural scroll reaches bottom → both badges clear

### 3.4 Error Handling

- ERR-01: Notification API permission denied → silently skip desktop notifications, show setting as disabled
- ERR-02: Custom sound file not found → fall back to system beep, log warning
- ERR-03: OSC 9 with empty message → use generic "Bell in <channel>" for notification body
- ERR-04: After WS reconnect, all background channels SHOULD be conservatively marked with activity dots (output may have occurred during disconnect).

## 4. Technical Design

### 4.1 Architecture Decision

Three-layer pipeline: Agent detects (bell + OSC 9) → Hub routes (broadcast to UI clients) → UI renders (badges, notifications, sound, unread bar). Activity tracking is purely UI-side — no new protocol for OUTPUT activity, only BELL and NOTIFICATION are new message types. Unread lines bar is a UI component that counts OUTPUT messages per channel since last focus.

### 4.2 Data Model Changes

No database schema changes. Bell counts and activity state are ephemeral (in-memory in UI).

| Entity | Change | Migration needed |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| (none) | — | No |

### 4.3 API Contract

No new REST endpoints. All notification data flows through WebSocket.

### 4.4 Protocol Messages (new)

```typescript
// Agent → Hub (MessagePack, snake_case on wire)
interface AgentBellMessage {
  type: "BELL"
  channel_id: string
}

interface AgentNotificationMessage {
  type: "NOTIFICATION"
  channel_id: string
  message: string  // OSC 9 text
}

// Hub → UI (WebSocket, camelCase)
interface HubBellMessage {
  type: "BELL"
  channelId: string
}

interface HubNotificationMessage {
  type: "NOTIFICATION"
  channelId: string
  message: string
}
```

**Design note:** Agent-side throttling: BELL debounced to 1 per 100ms per channel, OSC 9 debounced to 1 per 500ms per channel. Hub-side rate limiting: max 10 BELL/sec and 5 NOTIFICATION/sec per channel forwarded to UI.

### 4.5 Type Definitions (shared)

```typescript
type ScrollMode = "auto" | "alwaysBottom" | "alwaysResume"
type BellSound = "system" | "custom" | "mute"

interface NotificationConfig {
  desktopNotifications: boolean
  groupingWindowMs: number  // default 5000

  activity: {
    enabled: boolean
    minLines: number          // default 1
    debounceMs: number        // default 500
  }

  bell: {
    enabled: boolean
    sound: BellSound          // default "system"
    customSoundFile: string   // filename only, no path separators
    desktopNotification: boolean  // default true
  }

  osc9: {
    enabled: boolean
    desktopNotification: boolean  // default true
  }

  scroll: {
    mode: ScrollMode          // default "auto"
    autoThreshold: number     // default 100
  }
}
```

### 4.6 Config Additions

```toml
[notifications]
desktopNotifications = true
groupingWindowMs = 5000

[notifications.activity]
enabled = true
minLines = 1
debounceMs = 500

[notifications.bell]
enabled = true
sound = "system"
customSoundFile = ""
desktopNotification = true

[notifications.osc9]
enabled = true
desktopNotification = true

[notifications.scroll]
mode = "auto"
autoThreshold = 100
```

@priority:high @type:nominal
Scenario: SC-19 Tab active but not scrolled keeps badges
  Given channel "build" has activity dot and bell badge "3"

  And unread lines bar appears

@priority:medium @type:nominal
Scenario: SC-20 Mark as read clears badges
  Given channel "build" is active with unread lines bar visible
  When the user clicks "Mark as read"
  Then both activity dot and bell badge clear
  And unread lines bar disappears

```

### Scenario Group: Unread Lines Bar

```gherkin
@priority:high @type:nominal
Scenario: SC-21 Unread lines bar on tab switch (auto mode)
  Given scroll mode is "auto" with threshold 100
  And channel "build" received 47 new lines while inactive

  And the terminal resumes at the previous scroll position

@priority:medium @type:nominal
Scenario: SC-22 Auto mode scrolls to bottom above threshold
  Given scroll mode is "auto" with threshold 100
  And channel "build" received 150 new lines while inactive

@priority:medium @type:nominal
Scenario: SC-23 Always bottom mode
  Given scroll mode is "alwaysBottom"
  When the user switches to a tab with 50 new lines
  Then the terminal always scrolls to bottom
  And no unread lines bar appears

@priority:medium @type:nominal
Scenario: SC-24 Always resume mode
  Given scroll mode is "alwaysResume"
  When the user switches to a tab with 500 new lines
  Then the terminal resumes at previous position
  And unread lines bar shows "500 new lines"
```

### Scenario Group: Host Rail Aggregation

```gherkin
@priority:medium @type:nominal
Scenario: SC-25 Host rail aggregated badge
  Given host "prod" has 3 channels: 2 with bell badges (5 + 3)
  Then the host rail shows badge "8" on the "prod" host icon
```

### Scenario Group: Bell Flood Protection

```gherkin
@priority:high @type:edge
Scenario: SC-26 Bell flood throttled at agent
  Given a PTY outputs BEL char 100 times within 100ms

```gherkin
@priority:high @type:security
Scenario: SC-27 OSC 9 HTML injection stripped
  Given a PTY outputs OSC 9 with message '<script>alert(1)</script>'

  Given a PTY outputs OSC 9 with 500-char message
  When processed
  Then truncated to 256 chars

@priority:high @type:security

```

### Scenario Group: Activity Detection (continued)

```gherkin
@priority:medium @type:edge
Scenario: SC-30 WS reconnect marks background channels with activity

```

### Scenario Group: Bell Detection Pipeline (continued)

```gherkin
@priority:medium @type:edge
Scenario: SC-31 Bell on active tab plays sound but no badge

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Block 1: Protocol + Shared Types — 30min
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** None
**Packages:** shared

**Files:**
- `packages/shared/src/protocol.ts` — add BELL, NOTIFICATION to AgentToHubMessage and HubToUiMessage unions
- `packages/shared/src/config.ts` — add NotificationConfig type, extend DEFAULT_PROFILE with notification defaults

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] BELL and NOTIFICATION message types defined in protocol
- [ ] NotificationConfig type with all sub-sections
- [ ] DEFAULT_PROFILE includes notification defaults
- [ ] Shared package builds cleanly

### Block 2: Agent Bell + OSC 9 Detection — 45min
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** Block 1
**Packages:** agent

**Files:**
- `packages/agent/src/headless.ts` — add onBell(callback) method wrapping terminal.onBell, add registerOsc9Handler(callback) wrapping terminal.parser.registerOscHandler(9, ...). OSC 9 handler returns true (handled). Store IDisposable, call dispose() in HeadlessTerminal.dispose().
- `packages/agent/src/pty.ts` — add onBell(channelId, callback) and onOsc9(channelId, callback) delegation, same pattern as onTitleChange().
- `packages/agent/src/handler.ts` — add setupBellHandler() and setupOsc9Handler() following setupTitleChangeHandler pattern, called from handleSpawn(). Include per-channel throttle timers (100ms bell, 500ms OSC 9).

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] HeadlessTerminal detects BEL char via onBell() callback
- [ ] HeadlessTerminal detects OSC 9 via parser.registerOscHandler(9, ...)
- [ ] BELL message sent with correct channelId
- [ ] NOTIFICATION message sent with OSC 9 text
- [ ] Empty OSC 9 sends empty string (UI handles fallback text)
- [ ] OSC 9 message sanitized: strip control chars, strip HTML, truncate 256 chars, trim
- [ ] Bell throttled to 1 per 100ms per channel
- [ ] OSC 9 throttled to 1 per 500ms per channel

### Block 3: Hub Routing + Sound Serving — 45min
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** Block 1
**Packages:** hub

**Files:**
- `packages/hub/src/session/session-manager.ts` — wire BELL/NOTIFICATION from agent events to _broadcastToChannel
- `packages/hub/src/api/server.ts` — register @fastify/static for `~/.config/nexterm/sounds/` at `/public/sounds/` (same pattern as `/public/fonts/`, `decorateReply: false`). Auth bypass for `/public/sounds/` path.

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] BELL messages from agent forwarded to all connected UI WS clients
- [ ] NOTIFICATION messages from agent forwarded to all connected UI WS clients
- [ ] Messages include channelId for UI routing
- [ ] Hub rate-limits BELL to 10/sec/channel, NOTIFICATION to 5/sec/channel
- [ ] BELL and NOTIFICATION branches added to _wireAgentEvents if/else chain
- [ ] Hub serves custom sound files from ~/.config/nexterm/sounds/ at /public/sounds/
- [ ] Sound file validation: filename-only (no path separators), .wav/.mp3/.ogg extensions only

### Block 4: Notification Store + Activity Tracking — 1h
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** Block 1
**Packages:** web

**Design note:** Bell counts use shallowRef<Map<string, number>>. Notification store exposes two entry points: incrementBellCount(channelId) for badges (only when not active tab), and onBellReceived event (always, for sound). Move existing unreadChannels from channelsStore to notificationStore. Coordination: clearChannel(id) called on channel removal, clearAll(id) on select+scroll-bottom.

**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/stores/notifications.ts` — Pinia store for bell counts, activity dots, unread line counts
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useActivityTracker.ts` — debounced activity detection on OUTPUT messages

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Bell counts tracked per channel, increment on BELL message
- [ ] Activity dot tracked per channel, set on OUTPUT for inactive tab
- [ ] Activity debounce respects debounceMs setting
- [ ] Activity minLines threshold enforced
- [ ] Empty output ignored (hardcoded behavior, always true)
- [ ] Badge clear on: tab active + scroll bottom, mark-as-read, jump-to-bottom
- [ ] Host rail aggregation: sum of bell counts across channels per host

### Block 5: Visual Indicators (Tab, Sidebar, Rail) — 1h
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** Block 4
**Packages:** web

**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/TabBar.vue` — blue dot + red badge rendering
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/ChannelSidebar.vue` — blue dot + red badge
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/HostRail.vue` — aggregated red badge (depends on UX-03, adapt if not yet done)

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Blue dot (activity) visible on tab + sidebar for inactive channels with output
- [ ] Red badge with count visible on tab + sidebar for channels with bells
- [ ] Host rail shows aggregated bell count badge
- [ ] Badges styled distinctly (blue dot = 6px circle, red badge = rounded rect with number)

### Block 6: Desktop Notifications + Sound — 1h
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** Block 4
**Packages:** web

**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useDesktopNotifications.ts` — Notification API wrapper, grouping, click handler
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useBellSound.ts` — audio playback (system beep, custom file, mute)

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Permission request on first bell (if not already granted)
- [ ] Desktop notification shows on BELL when document.hidden
- [ ] Desktop notification shows on NOTIFICATION (OSC 9) with message text
- [ ] Grouping: N bells within groupingWindowMs → single notification "N alerts in <channel>"
- [ ] Click notification → focus window + activate channel tab
- [ ] Sound: system beep (AudioContext sine wave), custom file (Audio element), mute
- [ ] Sound only on bell, not on activity
- [ ] AudioContext created lazily on first user interaction (click/keypress) — not on first bell
- [ ] OSC 9 message HTML-stripped before Notification API body (defense-in-depth for Linux daemons)
- [ ] Grouping uses Notification API tag parameter: nexterm-bell-${channelId}. BELL and OSC 9 have separate tags.
- [ ] Grouping timers cleared on: channel removal, WS disconnect, composable unmount. dispose() returned.

### Block 7: Unread Lines Bar + Scroll Behavior — 1.5h
**Type:** Feature slice
**Dependencies:** Block 4
**Packages:** web

**Design note:** Unread line count = newline chars (0x0A) in OUTPUT Uint8Array data. Approximation (no terminal wrapping). Display caps at '999+ new lines'. Activity minLines uses same 0x0A counting for consistency.

**Files:**
- `packages/clients/web/src/components/UnreadLinesBar.vue` — overlay bar with line count, Mark as read, Jump buttons
- `packages/clients/web/src/composables/useScrollBehavior.ts` — scroll mode logic, line counter, resume/jump

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Unread line counter increments for each OUTPUT on inactive tab
- [ ] On tab switch (auto mode, < threshold): resume position + bar with "N new lines"
- [ ] On tab switch (auto mode, >= threshold): scroll to bottom + brief badge
- [ ] "Mark as read" clears badges, dismisses bar, keeps scroll position
- [ ] "Jump to bottom" clears badges, scrolls to bottom
- [ ] Natural scroll to bottom clears badges and dismisses bar
- [ ] Scroll up from bottom does NOT re-show bar
- [ ] alwaysBottom mode: always scrolls to bottom, no bar
- [ ] alwaysResume mode: always resumes, always shows bar if new lines
- [ ] Buffer trimming: if scrollback exceeded and resume marker is invalid/disposed, fall back to top of available buffer

## 7. Test Strategy

### Test Pyramid

| Level | Count | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Unit | 20 | Activity tracker, bell counter, grouping logic, scroll mode, sound selection |
| Integration | 8 | Agent bell/OSC 9 pipeline, hub routing, notification store lifecycle |
| E2E | 5 | Bell badge flow, activity dot flow, unread bar, desktop notification, sound |

### Test Data Requirements

**Fixtures:**
- PTY output containing BEL char (\x07)
- PTY output containing OSC 9 escape ('\e]9;message\a')
- Multiple OUTPUT messages for activity threshold testing
- NotificationConfig variations (all combos of enabled/disabled)

**Mocks:**
- Notification API (window.Notification)
- AudioContext for system beep
- document.hidden for visibility detection
- xterm.js onBell/parser for agent tests

### Per-Block Test Mapping

| Block | Unit | Integration | E2E |
|-------|------|-------------|-----|
| 1: Protocol + Types | 2 | — | — |
| 2: Agent Bell + OSC 9 | 4 | 2 | — |
| 3: Hub Routing | — | 2 | — |
| 4: Notification Store | 6 | 2 | — |
| 5: Visual Indicators | 3 | — | 2 |
| 6: Desktop + Sound | 3 | 1 | 2 |
| 7: Unread Bar + Scroll | 2 | 1 | 1 |

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Notification API not available (non-HTTPS in dev) | M | M | localhost is exempted; Vite dev server already serves on localhost |
| OSC 9 handler conflicts with xterm.js internal handling | M | L | Test thoroughly; xterm.js headless has no built-in OSC 9 handler |
| High-frequency bells overwhelming UI | M | M | Grouping window (5s) + badge cap display (show "99+" for > 99) |
| Audio autoplay blocked by browser | M | M | User interaction required before AudioContext creation; request on first bell click |
| Performance: line counting on every OUTPUT | L | L | Simple counter increment, no content parsing needed |

## 9. Definition of Done

- [ ] All 7 blocks implemented
- [ ] All 32 BDD scenarios have passing tests
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration + e2e)
- [ ] Lint/typecheck pass
- [ ] Bell detection works end-to-end (agent → hub → UI badge)
- [ ] OSC 9 triggers desktop notification with message
- [ ] Activity dot appears on background tab output
- [ ] Desktop notifications group within 5s window
- [ ] Sound plays on bell (system/custom/mute modes)
- [ ] Unread lines bar works in all 3 scroll modes
- [ ] Badge clear rules verified for all trigger conditions
- [ ] Code review clean (no blocking findings)

## 10. Dependencies & Integration Notes

- **UX-01 (complete):** TabBar, ChannelSidebar — badges render inside these components
- **UX-03 (Sprint 2):** HostRail — aggregated badge on host icon; if UX-03 not yet done, skip host rail badge (add in UX-03)
- **UX-06 (complete):** Theming — badge colors use CSS vars
- **Protocol:** BELL and NOTIFICATION added to shared protocol types; both use existing broadcast pattern (like TITLE_CHANGE)
- **Config:** notifications section added to config.toml and DEFAULT_PROFILE
