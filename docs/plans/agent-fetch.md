# AGENT-FETCH — Populate the agent binary cache from GitHub Releases + version-aware deploys (#77)

## §1 Scope

Connecting a remote SSH host requires the agent binary for that host's os/arch in the hub's
binary cache (`~/.local/state/termora/binaries/`). Today nothing populates it and the cache
naming (`termora-agent-<os>-<arch>`) differs from release asset naming
(`termora-agent-<triple>`), so first contact with a new architecture dead-ends in
`AGENT_NOT_AVAILABLE`.

In scope:
- **Auto-fetch on deploy**: when the deployer misses a binary, download the matching release
  asset, place it in the cache, continue the deploy.
- **Explicit command**: `termora-hub agent fetch <os-arch>|--all` to pre-populate or force-refresh.
- **Version-aware naming on BOTH surfaces** (user decision): release assets gain a version
  suffix; cache filenames gain a version suffix; the deployer resolves the version matching
  the hub.
- **Staleness policy**: the hub deploys agents of ITS OWN version (`HUB_VERSION`); a cached
  binary of another version triggers a re-fetch of the right one. At session establishment the
  existing `HELLO.agentVersion` is compared; mismatch right after a fresh deploy is an error,
  mismatch on a pre-existing remote agent is a warning.
- Out of scope: hub self-update, desktop updater, download of hub binaries, signed
  checksums/GitHub artifact attestations (follow-up — see §2 trust note), doc writing for
  the go-public transition (analysis only, separate deliverable).

## §2 Reality constraints & scope pivots

- **Auth pivot (user, 2026-06-11)**: instead of GitHub-token plumbing for the private repo,
  the project prepares to FLIP THE REPO PUBLIC (separate readiness analysis delivered with
  this spec). This spec assumes **unauthenticated downloads from public releases**. Transition
  state (repo still private): fetch fails with an actionable error naming the manual gesture
  (download URL + target cache path + rename) — no token configuration is built.
- **"Version in BOTH filename surfaces" (user decision)** — release assets AND cache files.
  Code constraint: release.yml's hub/desktop jobs download agent sidecars by glob; §3.5
  REPLACES those globs with exact versioned names (glob ambiguity bites once two assets match).
- **HELLO already carries `agentVersion`** (`crates/termora-agent/src/handler.rs`,
  `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`); since the release-please extra-files fix (#64/#68) hub and
  agent versions bump in lockstep. "Same version as hub" is a string equality, not a
  compatibility matrix — §3.5 adds a workflow guard asserting that lockstep at build time.
- **Dev builds are NOT release builds — and version shape cannot tell them apart**: in dev,
  `HUB_VERSION` resolves the package.json version (currently `0.3.4`), a perfectly valid
  semver. The dev guard is therefore anchored on **`detectSea()`** (already exported by
  `packages/hub/src/sea-addon-loader.ts`): auto-fetch runs ONLY in SEA builds; source runs
  (tsx/node) keep today's build-it-locally error. The §3.0 semver gate remains for URL input
  safety, not as a dev detector. Explicit `agent fetch` works in both modes (operator intent).
- v0.3.4 and earlier assets use UNVERSIONED names. The legacy fallback (§3.2) is gated on
  `version < 0.4.0` by SEMVER COMPARE — never on "file happens to be absent", which would be a
  silent verification-downgrade vector.
- **Checksum honesty**: `SHA256SUMS-<v>.txt` is served from the SAME origin as the binaries.
  It protects against corruption/truncation/wrong-asset — NOT malicious substitution. The
  authenticity boundary remains the existing deployer trust gate
  (`AGENT_BINARY_REJECTED`/`UNTRUSTED` + per-host verification), which runs UNCHANGED on
  fetched binaries. Signed checksums / artifact attestations are a tracked follow-up, not v1.

## §3 Design

### §3.0 Version input gate

Every version entering the fetch path (auto: `HUB_VERSION`; manual: `--version`) is validated
against strict semver `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` BEFORE any URL construction. `0.0.0` and non-matching
values ⇒ `FetchError("BAD_VERSION")` (auto path: deployer skips fetch and falls through to the
existing not-available error). Rationale: `TERMORA_VERSION` env flows into a network URL and
must be treated as untrusted input.

### §3.1 Naming & mapping

| Surface | Format | Example (0.4.0, RPi) |
|---|---|---|
| Release asset | `termora-agent-<triple>-<version><ext>` | `termora-agent-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-0.4.0` |
| Cache file | `termora-agent-<os>-<arch>-<version><ext>` | `termora-agent-linux-arm64-0.4.0` |

os-arch → triple mapping (ONE exported table, in the new `agent-fetch.ts`):

| os | arch | triple | built? |
|---|---|---|---|
| linux | x64 | x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu | yes |
| linux | arm64 | aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu | yes |
| windows | x64 | x86_64-pc-windows-msvc | yes (.exe) |
| windows | arm64 | — | no → `UNSUPPORTED_TARGET` |
| darwin | * | — | disabled → `UNSUPPORTED_TARGET` |

### §3.2 Fetch module (`packages/hub/src/session/agent-fetch.ts`, new)

`fetchAgentBinary({ os, arch, version, cacheDir, baseUrl?, fetchImpl? })`:

1. Validate version (§3.0); resolve triple (unknown → `UNSUPPORTED_TARGET`).
2. **HTTPS-only**: reject non-`https://` baseUrl (tests inject `fetchImpl`, never http URLs).
3. Download `<base>/releases/download/v<version>/termora-agent-<triple>-<version><ext>` with
   redirect-following. Timeouts: total AND idle/stall (a slow-drip stream must abort).
   Node fetch does NOT honor proxy env vars — documented v1 limitation (`NETWORK` error text
   mentions it).
4. HTTP error mapping (distinct, actionable): asset 404 while `GET /releases/tags/v<version>`
   succeeds ⇒ `RELEASE_INCOMPLETE` ("release exists, <triple> asset missing — release build in
   progress or failed"); both 404 ⇒ `NOT_FOUND`; 403 with rate-limit headers
   (`X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0` / `Retry-After`) ⇒ `RATE_LIMITED` (message carries the wait);
   other 403/401 ⇒ `PRIVATE_OR_FORBIDDEN` (message = the manual gesture: URL, cache path,
   rename). Legacy fallback: ONLY when `version < 0.4.0` (semver), retry the unversioned asset
   name.
5. Stream to a **unique** temp file in the cache dir (`<final>.<pid>.<rand>.tmp`, `O_EXCL`,
   `lstat`-guarded against symlinks). NOTE: `getBinaryCacheDir()` is a pure path resolver —
   nothing creates the directory today; `fetchAgentBinary` OWNS the
   `mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true, mode: 0o700 })`. Cap = 64 MiB on BYTES WRITTEN
   (abort mid-stream; never trust Content-Length; no transparent decompression). `ENOSPC` ⇒
   `FetchError("DISK")` + temp cleanup. Concurrent fetchers of the same target each use their
   own temp; each verifies its own temp; last atomic rename wins (both copies identical —
   double network work accepted in v1).
6. Checksum: download `SHA256SUMS-<version>.txt` (cached on disk per version to spare the
   unauthenticated rate-limit budget of 60 requests/hour/IP), parse with a PURE function
   (exact basename match, reject duplicate lines and path prefixes, normalize hex case,
   tolerate CRLF), verify the TEMP file BEFORE chmod/rename. Mismatch ⇒
   `FetchError("CHECKSUM_MISMATCH")`, temp removed. Missing sums file: `version < 0.4.0` ⇒
   warn + proceed (legacy); `>= 0.4.0` ⇒ hard `CHECKSUM_MISSING` error (downgrade-proof).
7. `chmod 755` the temp BEFORE the atomic rename to the final cache name.

`FetchError` (lives in `agent-fetch.ts`, hub-local — not protocol) codes:
`BAD_VERSION | UNSUPPORTED_TARGET | NOT_FOUND | RELEASE_INCOMPLETE | RATE_LIMITED |
PRIVATE_OR_FORBIDDEN | NETWORK | TOO_LARGE | DISK | CHECKSUM_MISMATCH | CHECKSUM_MISSING`.
Every message is actionable (what to run / where to put what file).

### §3.3 Deployer integration (`agent-deployer.ts`)

Lookup becomes `termora-agent-<os>-<arch>-<HUB_VERSION><ext>`. Miss ⇒ IF `detectSea()` AND
`HUB_VERSION` passes §3.0 → `fetchAgentBinary(version = HUB_VERSION)`; ELSE (source run) →
current `AGENT_NOT_AVAILABLE` error unchanged. `FetchError` ⇒
`DeployError("AGENT_NOT_AVAILABLE", <fetch message>)` (actionable text reaches the UI).
Stale versions stay in cache (debuggable); `agent fetch --prune` deletes non-current versions.

**Trust-gate honesty** (matches production, not the earlier draft wording): the TOFU
prompt/verification path (`AGENT_BINARY_REJECTED`/`UNTRUSTED`) fires ONLY when an agent binary
is found ALREADY PRESENT on the remote; uploads from the hub's own cache bypass it by design
(provenance = the hub's verified cache). For fetched binaries that provenance is established
by §3.2 (HTTPS, checksum, 0700 cache, atomic placement) — the spec adds NO new prompt on the
upload path.

Post-deploy HELLO check — **net-new code** (production only `console.warn`s on version
mismatch in `agent-connection-manager.ts` today): after `deployAgentIfNeeded` resolved
`deployed: true` and before the session transitions to connected, `hello.agentVersion !==
HUB_VERSION` ⇒ new structured `AGENT_VERSION_MISMATCH` error + session abort. When THIS
session did not deploy (pre-existing remote agent), keep the warning-only behavior.

### §3.4 CLI (`cli.ts`)

`agent fetch <os-arch>|--all [--version <v>] [--prune]` following the `host <sub>` parseArgs
pattern (command `agent-fetch`). Net-new parsing surface: `ParsedArgs` gains
`version?: string`, `all?: boolean`, `prune?: boolean`; `parseArgs` gains
`flagValue("--version", args)` plus the two booleans (`--version` is absent from the current
flag list — adding it must not collide with any future `-V` printing concern). Default
version = `HUB_VERSION` (validated §3.0). `--all`
attempts EVERY built target (no early abort), prints one status line per target (cache path or
error message), exits non-zero if ANY failed. Already-cached ⇒ "already cached" no-op line.
On today's private repo the command prints the `PRIVATE_OR_FORBIDDEN` manual gesture per target.

### §3.5 Release workflow (`release.yml`)

Every item below is **net-new** (no current anchor): today's upload loop produces unversioned
basenames with no `VERSION` variable, `publish-release` only deletes the web tarballs and
flips the draft, and draft reuse keeps assets verbatim.

1. Agent upload step: basename `termora-agent-${TRIPLE}-${VERSION}${ext}` (`VERSION="${TAG_NAME#v}"`).
2. **Version-consistency guard** (new step in create-release, after checkout): assert
   `${TAG_NAME#v}` == root package.json `.version` == `crates/termora-agent/Cargo.toml`
   package version; fail loudly otherwise (protects the HELLO lockstep assumption).
3. **SHA256SUMS: computed ONLY in `publish-release`** (the single serialized job) — download
   all `termora-agent-*-${VERSION}*` assets, verify COMPLETENESS against the matrix's enabled
   agent targets (fail if any expected triple is missing), write `SHA256SUMS-${VERSION}.txt`,
   upload it, THEN flip the draft public. Matrix jobs never touch the sums file — a shared
   file written from parallel jobs is a lost-update hazard by construction.
4. Hub/desktop sidecar downloads: replace globs with EXACT versioned asset names
   (`termora-agent-${TRIPLE}-${VERSION}${ext}`); fail if the download doesn't yield exactly
   one file; rename at copy time to the fixed unversioned sidecar names Tauri expects.
5. Draft-reuse hygiene: when reusing a draft, DELETE any legacy `termora-agent-${TRIPLE}` /
   `termora-hub-${TRIPLE}` (unversioned) assets left by older runs, so stale binaries can
   never be silently bundled or published alongside versioned ones.

## §4 BDD scenarios (annotated with their test seam)

1. **Cold RPi connect (auto-fetch)** — fetch+cache half: unit (injected `fetchImpl`, temp
   cache dir); SSH+deploy half: existing mock-SSH deployer spec with injected fetcher; full
   network path: deferred to the next real release (documented in PR).
2. **Explicit prefetch** — `agent fetch linux-arm64` populates then no-ops on rerun. Unit
   (injected fetch) + CLI parseArgs spec.
3. **Stale cache** — cache holds only an older version; deploy fetches the hub's version, the
   old file survives until `--prune`. Unit.
4. **Unsupported target** — windows-arm64 ⇒ `UNSUPPORTED_TARGET`, zero network calls. Pure unit.
5. **Private/offline** — injected 403 ⇒ `PRIVATE_OR_FORBIDDEN` message contains URL + cache
   path + rename; cache contains no partial file. Unit.
6. **Checksum mismatch** — injected corrupted body ⇒ `CHECKSUM_MISMATCH`, temp removed. Unit.
7. **Legacy tag fallback** — `--version 0.3.4` ⇒ unversioned asset name fetched, cached
   versioned, warning for missing sums; `--version 0.4.1` with missing sums ⇒
   `CHECKSUM_MISSING`. Unit.
8. **Old remote agent (no deploy this session)** — HELLO with an older `agentVersion` under a
   newer hub ⇒ warning logged, session proceeds; same mismatch right after an in-session
   deploy ⇒ `AGENT_VERSION_MISMATCH` abort. Seam: `agent-connection-manager.spec.ts` (where
   the HELLO handler and today's warn-only check live), using the existing UDS
   `net.createServer` harness pattern — NOT a full ssh2.Server stack.
9. **Source run (dev)** — `detectSea()` false ⇒ deployer never fetches regardless of
   `HUB_VERSION`; existing error unchanged. Unit (injected sea-detector).
10. **Concurrent double-fetch** — two parallel `fetchAgentBinary` calls for the same target:
    both succeed, exactly one final file, no interleaved corruption. Unit (real FS, two
    concurrent invocations).

## §5 Implementation blocks (vertical slices)

- **B1** `agent-fetch.ts`: mapping table, version gate, fetch flow (temp/atomic/cap/timeouts),
  SHA256SUMS pure parser, `FetchError` + all codes — with the full unit battery (scenarios
  2-7, 9-10 seams).
- **B2** Deployer integration: versioned lookup, guarded auto-fetch, HELLO version check +
  `AGENT_VERSION_MISMATCH` — deployer spec extended (scenario 1 deploy-half, 8).
- **B3** CLI `agent fetch` (`--all` / `--version` / `--prune`) + parseArgs/cmd specs.
- **B4** release.yml: versioned asset names, version-consistency guard, publish-release
  SHA256SUMS (completeness-checked), exact-name sidecar downloads + rename-at-copy,
  draft-reuse legacy-asset cleanup. actionlint; live proof at the next release.

## §6 Test requirements

Vitest colocated; real FS temp dirs; network ONLY via injected `fetchImpl` (no module mocks —
deps are parameters). SHA256SUMS parser: table-driven pure tests (missing line, duplicates,
CRLF, hex case, path prefixes). Deployer security tests (binary trust) must pass unchanged.
80/80 + no-mock conventions. release.yml: actionlint + next-release live proof.

## §8 External consensus review ledger

Independent second-family review; high agreement with §7. Net-new findings, all folded:
