# termora

A local-first session terminal platform. Hub daemon + remote agents + SSH transport + PWA UI.
Sessions survive client disconnects and device switches; local sessions also survive hub restarts.

## Features

- **Session persistence** — terminal sessions outlive client/UI disconnects and device switches; reconnect and resume exactly where you left off. Local sessions also survive hub restarts. (Surviving a dropped SSH *transport* to a remote host — so a remote session keeps running across a network blip — is on the roadmap, not yet shipped.)
- **SSH stdio transport** — agents run over SSH stdio; no extra ports opened on remote machines
- **Local-first** — the hub daemon owns all state; the UI is a thin client that can come and go
- **Multi-device** — attach to the same session from any browser or device; write-lock prevents conflicting input
- **Remote agents** — same agent binary runs locally (child process) or remotely (SSH); hub handles both identically
- **Custom themes** — per-host and per-channel visual identity with Discord-style host rail
- **Launch profiles** — named shell configurations with environment, working directory, and elevation settings
- **Elevation support** — configurable elevation methods per host (sudo, doas, pkexec, gsudo, custom)
- **Config cascade** — 4-layer deep merge: built-in defaults → `config.toml` → host profile → channel profile

## Quick Start

Once published to npm:

```sh
npx termora
```

Open `http://localhost:4100` in your browser.

## Architecture

```
UI (Vue 3 + xterm.js) ──── WS + REST ──── Hub (Fastify, 127.0.0.1:4100)
                                            ├── Local Agent (child_process, stdio)
                                            ├── Remote Agent (ssh2, stdio)
                                            ├── meta.db  (hosts, sessions, workspaces)
                                            └── spool.db (output chunks, snapshots)

Agent (local or remote, same binary):
	stdin  → MessagePack frames → PTY manager (node-pty) → N channels
	stdout ← MessagePack frames ← OUTPUT / SNAPSHOT

Hub never touches PTY directly — the agent is the universal PTY manager.
```

The hub daemon binds to `127.0.0.1:4100` and serves both the REST API (`/api/*`) and the WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`). All PTY management is delegated to the agent process, whether local or remote.

### Agent distribution

The hub bundles the agent binary for **its own** OS/arch (used for local sessions, available offline at
install). Agents for **remote** SSH hosts of other OS/arch are **not** bundled — the hub downloads the
matching, version-matched, checksum-verified binary from GitHub Releases on demand and uploads it to the host
over SFTP, so the remote host never needs outbound internet. Pre-populate with `termora-hub agent fetch
<os-arch> | --all`.

> **Air-gapped note:** this assumes the **hub** has outbound internet. If the hub itself is air-gapped, a
> fetch fails with an actionable message (download URL + cache path + filename); download the binary and its
> `SHA256SUMS` on a connected machine, transfer them, and drop them in the binary cache. See
> [`docs/SPEC.md` §3.5](docs/SPEC.md) for the full distribution model.

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20 LTS
- pnpm >= 9

### Setup

```sh
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Start hub + UI dev servers concurrently
pnpm dev
```

The hub starts on `http://localhost:4100` and the Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Commands

```sh
pnpm build            # Build all packages
pnpm test             # Run all tests (vitest)
pnpm lint             # Lint + format check (biome)
pnpm lint:fix         # Auto-fix lint issues

# Single-package operations
pnpm -F @termora/hub test
pnpm -F @termora/web dev
```

### Headless local-spawn testing

Use the headless harness to exercise the hub WebSocket `AUTH` + `SPAWN` path without opening
the browser or touching your real Termora state:

```sh
scripts/dev/headless-hub-test.sh start   # isolated hub on :4199 with debug logging enabled
scripts/dev/headless-hub-test.sh spawn   # run AUTH + SPAWN probe
scripts/dev/headless-hub-test.sh logs    # hub connection-lifecycle log tail
scripts/dev/headless-hub-test.sh alog    # local agent daemon log tail
scripts/dev/headless-hub-test.sh stop
scripts/dev/headless-hub-test.sh reset
```

The harness writes all config, runtime, and state under `.tt/headless-hub/`. Override the
location or port with `TT_DIR=/tmp/termora-headless` or `TT_PORT=4201`. The hub's dev
agent resolver uses `target/release/termora-agent`, so rebuild that binary after Rust changes
before relying on the agent daemon log tail.

### Production build (single executable)

Build a self-contained release locally (Linux/macOS native):

```sh
./scripts/build-agent.sh   # Rust agent → dist/sea/termora-agent  (cargo --release)
./scripts/build-hub.sh     # Hub SEA    → dist/sea/termora-hub
                           #   builds the web UI, embeds it, bundles better-sqlite3,
                           #   and produces a Node Single Executable Application
```

Both binaries land co-located in `dist/sea/`; the hub resolves the agent next to its own executable. Run it:

```sh
cd dist/sea
./termora-hub start --port 4100   # serves the PWA at http://127.0.0.1:4100  (add --daemon / --open)
./termora-hub pair                # prints an 8-digit code to authorise a new browser client
./termora-hub status              # or: ./termora-hub stop
```

Config lives in `~/.config/termora`, runtime state in `~/.local/state/termora`.

> A native SEA embeds the host Node runtime, so build on the OS you target — a cross-platform binary
> (e.g. the Windows hub) must be produced on that platform.

---

## Configuration

termora reads configuration from a TOML file:

- **Linux / macOS:** `~/.config/termora/config.toml`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\termora\config.toml`

State (databases, runtime socket) is stored in:

- **Linux / macOS:** `~/.local/state/termora/`
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\termora\`

The port defaults to `4100` and can be overridden via:

1. CLI flag `--port`
2. Environment variable `TERMORA_PORT`
3. `port` key in `config.toml`

Terminal background settings live in `[terminal]` and cascade to host/channel profiles:

```toml
[terminal]
wallpaper = "forest.webp"
wallpaper_blur = 4
wallpaper_dim = 25

# image = wallpaper when set, otherwise solid; solid = opaque theme background;
# transparent = desktop transparency in Tauri, solid fallback in browsers.
background_mode = "transparent"

# Desktop-only native effect. auto maps to blur on Windows 10, mica on Windows 11,
# vibrancy-under-window on macOS, and none on Linux.
window_effect = "auto"
```

In `zero_conf` mode the hub auto-increments from 4100 to 4199 if the default port is taken, and writes the actual port to `runtime.json` in the state directory.
