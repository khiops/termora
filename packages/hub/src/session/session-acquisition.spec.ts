/**
 * session-acquisition.spec.ts — One test per invariant 1–9.
 *
 * Each test carries a "Mutation oracle" comment that names the exact
 * code mutation that would make the test fail. This proves the test
 * is testing the stated invariant and not an accident.
 *
 * Invariant summary (from docs/plans/session-acquisition-redesign.md):
 *   1. Follower lease keeps refcount ≥ 1 until release() — no premature reap.
 *   2. Outer finally releases the lease on every exit path (throw-safe).
 *   3. Reap triggered by lease count reaching 0, not channel-presence alone.
 *   4. Identity-checked removals — only the owning acq may remove itself.
 *   5. Prompts cleared by ownerAcqId — a newer prompt from a different acq survives.
 *   6. release() is idempotent — double-release does not underflow or double-reap.
 *   7. Commit guard: acq identity + state + signal + session currency must all hold.
 *   8. Single authority (P2): acq deleted from map on commit().
 *   9. join() refused after CLOSING is set — terminal state precedes async teardown.
