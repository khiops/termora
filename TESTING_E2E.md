## Core (1-18)

### 1. Channel creation

- Click "+" in tab bar → new tab opens with prompt, Writer indicator, green sidebar dot
- Click "+" in sidebar header → same result
- Sidebar count increments (GENERAL: N)

### 2. Tab switching

- Click tab 1 → switches to tab 1, sidebar highlights matching channel
- Click tab 2 → switches to tab 2, sidebar highlights matching channel
- Click channel in sidebar → switches to its tab

### 3. Sidebar re-selection

- Click an already-selected channel → tab stays open (no blank state)
- Close a tab via "x" button → click the channel in sidebar → tab re-opens

### 4. Shell exit (dead channel — readonly mode)

- Type `exit` in terminal → "Closed" badge appears, tab stays open (readonly)
- Sidebar dot turns grey
- Write-lock indicator (Writer/Release) hidden on dead tab
- Other channel tabs remain unaffected
- Can still scroll and select text in dead tab (copy-paste)

### 5. Explicit channel deletion (context menu)

- Right-click dead channel in sidebar → "Close channel" → tab closes immediately
- Right-click live channel in sidebar → "Close channel" → tab closes immediately
- Sidebar count decrements
- Remaining tabs/channels unaffected
- No "Starting..." ghost tab appears

### 6. Delete fallback selection

- Delete the currently selected channel → selection falls back to next alive channel
- Fallback channel's tab opens/focuses automatically
- If no channels remain → empty state ("Select a channel or click +")

### 7. Multi-channel lifecycle

- Open 3 channels (A, B, C)
- Kill B with `exit` → B shows "Closed", A and C still live
- Delete B via context menu → B's tab closes, A and C intact
- Kill C with `exit` → C shows "Closed", A still live
- Delete A via context menu → falls back to C (dead, readonly)
- Delete C → empty state

### 8. Page reload persistence

- With 2 tabs open, reload page → tabs restored from localStorage
- Active tab preserved after reload
- Dead channel tabs restored with "Closed" badge

### 9. Write-lock indicator

- Live channel: shows green dot + "Writer" + "Release" button
- Dead channel: indicator completely hidden
- After releasing write lock: shows "No lock" (grey dot)
- After re-claiming: shows "Writer" again

### 10. Host rail status

- Local host shows green dot when agent is running
- Pulsing/red dot when agent is disconnected
- Status recovers after warm restart

### 11. Terminal I/O

- Type `echo HELLO` + Enter → output `HELLO` appears in terminal
- Type `pwd` + Enter → current directory shown
- Type `ls --color` → colored output renders correctly
- Rapid typing (paste a long string) → no dropped characters
- Ctrl+C interrupts a running command (e.g. `sleep 999`)

### 12. Channel rename (inline edit)

- Double-click channel name in sidebar → inline input appears
- Type new name + Enter → name updates in sidebar and tab bar
- Press Escape → cancels rename, original name preserved
- Double-click tab label → inline input appears (same behavior)
- Empty name rejected (reverts to original)

### 13. Channel group management

- Click "+ Add group" → new group appears in sidebar (e.g. "GROUP 2")
- New channel created in selected group appears under that group
- Drag channel from GENERAL to GROUP 1 → channel moves, counts update
- Drag channel back → channel returns to original group
- Delete empty group → group removed from sidebar
- Delete group with channels → channels move to default group (GENERAL)

### 14. Daemon survival (hub restart)

Precondition: 2+ live channels with output, agent running as daemon.

- Run `echo BEFORE_RESTART` in terminal A
- Stop hub (`dev-stop.sh` kills hub but agent survives — or restart hub only)
- Start hub again (`dev-start.sh`)
- Reload page → channels reappear in sidebar with green dots (alive)
- Click channel A → scrollback preserved (contains `BEFORE_RESTART`)
- Type `echo AFTER_RESTART` → terminal still functional
- Channel B also restored with its scrollback

### 15. Daemon death recovery

- Kill agent daemon process (`kill <agent-pid>`)
- Sidebar channels turn grey/dead (agent disconnected)
- Hub auto-restarts agent daemon (check `agent.sock` reappears)
- Create new channel → works normally (new agent)
- Old channels show as dead (PTYs lost with agent process)

### 16. WS reconnect (network blip)

- With active terminal, disconnect network briefly (disable adapter or DevTools offline)
- Reconnect → WS auto-reconnects (exponential backoff)
- Terminal resumes working (type command, see output)
- No duplicate tabs or ghost channels after reconnect

### 17. Multiple browser tabs (write-lock contention)

- Open nexterm in two browser tabs
- Tab A has write lock on channel X
- Tab B clicks channel X → sees "No lock" (reader mode)
- Tab B force-takes write lock → Tab A loses lock, shows "No lock"
- Tab A reclaims → Tab B loses lock

### 18. Page reload with daemon

- Open 3 channels, type distinct commands in each
- Reload page (F5) → all 3 tabs restored
- Each terminal shows its previous scrollback (snapshot restore)
- Write lock auto-claimed on active tab

---

## Theming — UX-06 (19-25)

### 19. Theme switching

- Open appearance panel → theme picker shows 9 bundled presets
- Click "dracula" → chrome colors update immediately (sidebar, tab bar, host rail)
- Terminal ANSI colors update (run `ls --color` → colors match dracula palette)
- Click "solarized-light" → light theme applied (bright backgrounds, dark text)
- Click "catppuccin-mocha" → back to default dark theme

### 20. Theme live preview on hover

- Hover over a theme in the picker → chrome + terminal preview instantly
- Move mouse away → reverts to current theme (no commit)
- Click the hovered theme → preview becomes permanent

### 21. Theme editor

- Open theme editor → color pickers for all 22 terminal + 15 UI colors
- Change a terminal color (e.g. red) → terminal updates live
- Change a UI color (e.g. --nt-bg-primary) → chrome updates live
- Save → theme file written, appears in picker
- Cancel → changes discarded, original theme restored

### 22. Theme import/export

- Export current theme → JSON file downloaded
- Import a valid theme JSON → theme appears in picker and is selectable
- Import invalid JSON → error message, no crash

### 23. OS auto-switch (dark/light)

- Enable auto-switch in appearance settings
- Set light theme for "light" and dark theme for "dark"
- Toggle OS dark mode → theme switches automatically
- Manually select a theme → auto-switch disables (SC-14)

### 24. Background opacity

- Adjust opacity slider → terminal + chrome background becomes translucent
- At 100% → fully opaque (default)
- At ~80% → desktop visible behind terminal area
- Reload page → opacity setting preserved

### 25. Scrollbar styling

- Set scrollbar style to "thin" → xterm scrollbar narrows
- Set to "wide" → scrollbar widens
- Set to "hidden" → scrollbar disappears (scroll still works via mouse wheel)
- --nt-scrollbar-width CSS var applied correctly

---

## Tab Actions & Split Panes — UX-01 (26-36)

### 26. Tab context menu

- Right-click a tab → context menu appears with: Close, Close Others, Close to the Right, Close All
- Click away → menu dismisses
- Menu positioned at click coordinates (no overflow off-screen)

### 27. Close Others / Close to the Right / Close All

Precondition: 4 tabs open (A, B, C, D), tab B selected.

- Right-click B → "Close Others" → A, C, D tabs vacated, B remains
- Undo: reopen channels. Right-click C → "Close to the Right" → D vacated, A, B, C remain
- Right-click any → "Close All" → all tabs vacated (panes show vacant state, tabs stay)

### 28. Confirm dialogs (close actions)

- "Close All" triggers confirmation dialog (if confirmCloseAll enabled)
- Dialog shows "Remember for host" and "Remember globally" checkboxes
- Check "Remember globally" + confirm → next "Close All" skips dialog
- Clear localStorage `nexterm:skipConfirm*` → dialogs return

### 29. Split panes — horizontal and vertical

- With 1 terminal open, use split action → pane splits into 2 (vacant + terminal)
- Split again → 3 panes visible
- Split once more → 4 panes (max reached)
- Attempt 5th split → blocked (max 4 panes enforced, INV-02)
- Each vacant pane shows channel picker

### 30. Vacant pane — channel picker

- Click a vacant pane → picker appears with available detached channels
- Select a channel → terminal loads in that pane (attach)
- Click "+" in picker → new channel created and assigned to pane
- Vacant pane with no available channels → shows "+" only

### 31. Pane close and collapse

- Close a pane (X button on pane header) → pane becomes vacant
- Close the last non-vacant pane in a split → split collapses, parent resizes
- Root pane close → tab stays open with vacant pane (INV-04: tab never auto-closes)

### 32. Cross-tab pane drag & drop

Precondition: 2 tabs, each with 1 terminal pane.

- Drag pane header from tab A → drop on tab B's center → replaces pane content
- Tab A shows vacant pane (channel detached, not killed — INV-03)
- Drop on left edge (25%) → horizontal split, dropped pane on left
- Drop on right edge → horizontal split, dropped pane on right
- Drop on top edge → vertical split, dropped pane on top
- Drop on bottom edge → vertical split, dropped pane on bottom
- Same-tab drag: move pane within a split → swaps positions

### 33. Pane resize (splitter drag)

- Drag the splitter between two panes → both resize proportionally
- Release → ratio preserved
- Resize persists after tab switch and return

### 34. Welcome tab

- First visit to host (or autoOpenWelcome=true) → welcome tab auto-opens with ★ icon
- Welcome tab shows configurable content (per-host)
- Star icon (★) visible in both tab bar and sidebar
- Only one welcome tab per host (enforce via transaction)
- Close welcome tab → can reopen via sidebar context menu

### 35. Configure command + direct process

- Right-click channel → "Configure Command" → dialog to set shell/args/directProcess
- Set command to `htop` with directProcess=true → channel runs htop directly
- When htop exits → exit overlay appears: Restart / Configure Command / Close
- Click "Restart" → htop relaunches in same channel
- Click "Configure Command" → back to dialog
- Click "Close" → channel vacated

### 36. Channel sidebar context menu

- Right-click channel in sidebar → context menu: Open in Current Tab, Open in New Tab, Rename, Close Channel
- "Open in Current Tab" → replaces active pane content with this channel
- "Open in New Tab" → creates new tab with this channel
- "Rename" → inline rename input
- "Close Channel" → channel deleted (with confirmation if live)

---

## Terminal Title — UX-02 (37-43)

### 37. Dynamic title from OSC sequences

- Run `vim` → tab title changes to "vim" (OSC 0/2 sequence)
- Exit vim → tab title reverts to previous (title stack)
- Run `ssh user@server` → title changes to "user@server"
- Run `htop` → title changes to "htop"
- Sidebar also shows dynamic title (without prefix)

### 38. Title priority chain

- Channel with no activity → shows fallback ("Terminal" or custom)
- Run a command → dynamic title appears (live OSC override)
- Double-click tab to rename (F2) → custom title overrides dynamic
- While custom title set, run vim → custom title stays (custom > dynamic)

### 39. Title truncation

- Run a command that produces a very long title (e.g. deep nested path)
- Tab title truncates with "…" at end (default position)
- Full title visible on hover (tooltip)
- Sidebar title also truncates appropriately

### 40. Window title (document.title)

- Switch to a tab → browser window/tab title updates to formatted string
- Format includes host prefix, channel title (configurable tokens)
- Switch tabs → window title follows active pane
- With no tabs → window title shows app name only

### 41. Per-host title prefix

- Configure a host with prefix "PROD" → all channels on that host show "PROD: <title>"
- Prefix applied before truncation (counts toward char limit)
- Sidebar titles do NOT show prefix (SC-15)

### 42. Reset title to dynamic

- Rename a channel to custom title via double-click
- Right-click tab → "Reset Title to Dynamic" appears (only when custom title set)
- Click "Reset" → title reverts to current dynamic title (or fallback if no OSC)
- Menu item grayed out when title is already dynamic

### 43. Title persistence across reconnect

- Run vim → dynamic title "vim" displayed
- Reload page → after reattach, dynamic title restored from DB (ATTACH_OK carries dynamicTitle)
- Custom title also preserved after reload

- Input is auto-focused
- Press Escape → overlay closes, terminal refocused
- Press Ctrl+Shift+F again → overlay reopens with previous query

### 45. Incremental search + highlighting

- Type a query (e.g. "echo") → matches highlighted in terminal as you type
- Match count displayed (e.g. "3/12" — current match / total)
- Typing more characters narrows results (incremental)
- Clear input → highlights removed, count resets to "0/0"

### 46. Match navigation

- Press Enter → scrolls to next match, current match counter increments
- Press Shift+Enter → scrolls to previous match, counter decrements
- Click "▼" button → next match
- Click "▲" button → previous match
- At last match + Enter → wraps to first match
- At first match + Shift+Enter → wraps to last match

### 47. Case-sensitive toggle

- Click "Aa" button (or Alt+C) → case-sensitive mode enabled (button highlighted)
- Search "Echo" case-sensitive → only matches exact case
- Toggle off → "echo", "Echo", "ECHO" all match
- Toggle state reflected in button appearance

### 48. Regex search

- Click ".*" button (or Alt+R) → regex mode enabled
- Type `echo\s+\w+` → matches "echo" followed by word
- Regex badge "[.*]" appears in input area

- Fix regex → error clears, matches appear

### 49. Whole word toggle

- Click "W" button (or Alt+W) → whole-word mode enabled
- Search "echo" → matches standalone "echo" but not "echotest"
- Toggle off → "echotest" also matches

### 50. Scrollbar markers

- Search a query with multiple matches → orange/yellow marks appear on scrollbar
- Active match shown with different color (pink) on scrollbar
- Navigate matches → active marker moves on scrollbar
- Clear search → markers disappear
- Scrollbar markers respect terminal profile setting (can be disabled)

- Navigation works normally on frozen buffer

### 52. Highlight on close behavior

- With highlightOnClose="clear" → close overlay → highlights removed immediately
- With highlightOnClose="fade" → close overlay → highlights fade after ~300ms
- With highlightOnClose="persist" → close overlay → highlights remain visible

### 53. Multi-pane search — scope toggle

Precondition: 2+ panes visible in current tab (split view).

- Open search → scope toggle visible ("1" = current pane, "All" = all panes)
- Default scope: current pane ("1" active)
- Click "All" → search expands to all panes, total match count aggregates
- Match count shows combined total across all panes

### 54. Multi-pane search — cross-pane navigation

Precondition: 2 panes with matches in both, scope="All".

- Press Enter → navigates through current pane matches
- After last match in current pane → focus jumps to next pane with matches
- Next pane highlights and scrolls to its first match
- Continue → cycles through all panes with wrap-around
- Shift+Enter → reverse direction, same cross-pane behavior
- Pane with zero matches → skipped during navigation

### 55. Multi-pane search — single pane

- With only 1 pane visible → scope toggle NOT visible
- Search works normally (single-pane mode)

### 56. Search history

- Perform several searches: "foo", "bar", "baz"
- Close and reopen search → click empty input or focus → history dropdown appears
- History shows recent queries in MRU order: "baz", "bar", "foo"
- Click a history entry → populates input, executes search
- Search "foo" again → deduplicates, "foo" moves to top
- Regex searches show [.*] badge in history dropdown
- History persists across page reload (localStorage)

### 57. Search overlay position

- Default position: top-right of terminal pane
- Change config to "bottom-right" → overlay moves to bottom-right
- Change config to "bottom-bar" → overlay spans full width at bottom
- Overlay does not cover terminal text (scrolls content if needed)

### 58. Search keyboard shortcuts summary

- Ctrl+Shift+F → open search (from terminal)

- Cancel deletion → host remains
- Confirm deletion → host removed from rail, associated channels closed
- Attempt delete on local host → option NOT available in context menu

### 62. Duplicate host

- Right-click host → "Duplicate" → new host appears as "hostname-copy"
- Duplicate again → "hostname-copy-2" created
- Verify duplicate inherits SSH config from original

### 63. SSH config import (single)

- Click [+] in host rail → select "From SSH config" source
- Dropdown lists hosts from ~/.ssh/config
- Select a host → fields auto-fill (hostname, port, user, key)
- Click Save → host created with ssh_config_host field set
- If ~/.ssh/config missing → error message shown

### 64. Batch SSH config import

### 65. Host groups — create & assign

- In Add Host modal, click Group dropdown → existing groups listed
- Click "+ New group" → type group name → group created
- Save host → host appears under correct group separator in rail
- New host without group → appears in default/ungrouped section

### 66. Host groups — collapse/expand

- Collapse state persists across page reload

### 67. Host groups — rename & delete

- Right-click group separator → "Rename Group" → inline edit
- Type new name + Enter → separator label updates
- Right-click group → "Delete Group" → confirmation
- Confirm → group removed, hosts move to ungrouped section
- Active sessions on moved hosts continue uninterrupted

### 68. Host DnD reorder

---

## Notifications — UX-05 (71-80)

### 71. Bell badge on inactive tab

- Open 2 channels (A, B), switch to B
- In A (background), run `echo -e '\a'` → red badge "1" appears on A's tab
- Run bell again → badge increments to "2"
- Bell on active tab (B) → no badge (already focused)

### 72. Activity dot on background output

- Switch to channel B, channel A is background
- Channel A receives output (e.g., running script) → blue dot on A's tab
- Whitespace-only output does NOT trigger dot
- Activity dot is separate from bell badge (blue vs red)

### 73. Badge/dot clear on tab focus

- Channel A has activity dot + bell badge "3"
- Click A's tab → terminal auto-scrolls to bottom
- Both activity dot and bell badge clear
- If not scrolled to bottom → badges remain, unread bar shows

### 74. Unread line bar

Precondition: channel A has new lines while inactive.

- Click A's tab → unread bar appears: "N new lines"
- Click "Jump to bottom" → terminal scrolls to bottom, bar + badges clear
- Click "Mark as read" → badges clear, scroll position unchanged
- Manually scroll to bottom → bar dismisses automatically
- After reaching bottom, scrolling up does NOT re-show bar

### 75. Desktop notification on bell

Precondition: Notification API permission granted, document hidden (minimized/other browser tab).

- Background channel outputs BEL → desktop notification with channel name
- Multiple bells within 5s → grouped: "N alerts in channel"
- Click notification → browser focuses, channel tab activates
- Permission denied → no notification, but badge still increments

### 76. OSC 9 notification

- Background channel outputs `echo -e '\e]9;Build done!\a'` → bell badge + activity dot
- Desktop notification shows "Build done!" in body (when document hidden)
- Empty OSC 9 message → generic "Bell in channel" text
- OSC 9 on active/focused tab → no desktop notification
- HTML in OSC 9 message → tags stripped (XSS prevention)

### 77. Bell sound

- Set bell sound to "system" → BEL char triggers system beep
- Set to "mute" → no sound, badge still increments
- Set to "custom" with valid .wav/.mp3 file → custom sound plays
- Activity (OUTPUT) never triggers sound — only BEL does

### 78. Scroll mode — auto

- Set scroll.mode to "auto" with threshold 100 (default)
- Channel receives few lines while inactive → activate tab → resumes position, unread bar "N new lines"
- Channel receives 150+ lines → activate tab → scrolls to bottom, no bar

### 79. Scroll mode — alwaysBottom / alwaysResume

- Set scroll.mode to "alwaysBottom" → any new output, tab always scrolls to bottom on focus
- Set scroll.mode to "alwaysResume" → always resumes position with unread bar, even for 500+ lines

### 80. Host rail & sidebar indicators

- Host with 3 channels with bells (5 + 3 + 0) → host rail shows aggregated badge "8"
- Channel sidebar: activity → blue dot, bells → red badge with count
- Both indicators visible simultaneously on different channels

---

## Host Customization — UX-07 (81-88)

### 81. Visual preset selection

- Open host modal → Advanced section → Visual Profile
- Select "None" → all visual elements disabled (default)
- Select "Caution" → banner "STAGING - {host}" (yellow), subtle border, 3% yellow tint
- Select "Danger" → banner "PRODUCTION - {host}" (red), strong border, 5% red tint
- Save → open terminal for host → visual profile applied

### 82. Custom preset (modify switches)

- Select "Danger" preset → change tint opacity from 5% to 10%
- Preset auto-switches to "Custom"
- Other values (banner text, border) remain unchanged
- Save → reload → "Custom" preset persisted with modified values

### 83. Environment banner

- Host with banner enabled → banner appears between pane header and terminal
- Banner text centered, uppercase, bold
- Banner background + text colors match configured values
- Banner with `flex-shrink: 0` — does not collapse on small panes

### 84. Banner token substitution

- Set banner text to "ENV: {host} ({ip}) [{group}]"
- Open terminal → banner shows host/ip/group substituted
- Host without group → {group} renders as literal "{group}"
- Local host without sshHost → {ip} renders as "localhost"
- HTML in host name → rendered as text, NOT executed (XSS safe)

### 85. Accent border styles

- Border "none" → no visible border on terminal pane
- Border "subtle" → 2px left border in configured color
- Border "strong" → 3px border on left, right, and bottom
- Empty border color → falls back to host's primary color
- Custom border color overrides host color

### 86. Background tint

- Enable tint with color + 5% opacity → colored overlay visible on terminal
- Tint overlay: pointer-events: none (clicks pass through to terminal)
- Text remains readable under tint
- Attempt to set opacity > 15% → clamped to 15%

### 87. Tint slider with live preview

- Open Visual Profile settings → enable tint
- TintPreview shows fake terminal lines with current tint applied
- Drag opacity slider → preview updates in real-time
- Color picker change → preview updates immediately

### 88. Split panes with different host profiles

Precondition: 2 hosts configured — "prod" (Danger preset) and "staging" (Caution preset).

- Open terminal with pane A connected to "prod"
- Split → assign pane B to "staging"
- Pane A: red banner, strong red border, red tint
- Pane B: yellow banner, subtle yellow border, yellow tint
- Each pane renders its own host's profile independently (not global)

---

## Regressions (89-93)

### 89. Bell badge on active tab (regression: 1f55b40, e74cc37)

Precondition: 1 host "local", 2 channels, active tab = "Terminal".

- Type `printf '\x07'` + Enter in the active terminal
- Bell badge "1" appears on host rail, channel sidebar, and tab bar within 200ms
- All three badges auto-dismiss after ~1s (still on same tab)
- Bell on background channel → badge persists until user clicks back

### 90. Scroll does not clear bell badge (regression: 1f55b40)

Precondition: 1 host "local", 1 channel with scrollback output.

- Type `printf '\x07'` → bell badge appears on all 3 locations
- Scroll up in terminal → bell badge still visible
- Scroll back to bottom → bell badge still visible (only auto-dismiss timer clears it)
- Unread lines bar (if shown) clears independently of bell badge

### 91. No auto-spawn on SSH host switch (regression: b013a6c)

Precondition: 1 local host with channels, 1+ SSH host without active session.

- Click SSH host in rail → sidebar shows "No channels yet", no "Starting..." tab
- Wait 10s — no SPAWN timeout error appears
- Click back on local host → existing channels listed, no phantom tab
- Repeat switch 3 times — no ghost tabs accumulate

### 92. Group action dialogs (regression: 73336ae)

Precondition: 1 host "local", 1+ channel group.

- Right-click group header → "Rename group" → application modal (NOT system prompt())
- Type new name, click Rename → group renamed
- Press Escape or click outside → modal closes, no rename
- Right-click group header → "Delete group" → danger confirmation modal (NOT system confirm())
- Click Cancel → group still exists
- Click Delete → group removed, channels moved to default

### 93. Hidden pane scroll does not clear unread lines (regression: useScrollBehavior fix)

Precondition: 1 host "local", 2 channels (A, B), both alive.

- Switch to channel A (active), B is inactive/hidden via v-show
- B receives output in background → unreadLines accumulates for B
- xterm.js auto-scroll on hidden pane does NOT clear unreadLines
- Switch to B → unread bar appears with correct line count
- "Jump ↓" clears bar and scrolls to bottom
